support visual data processing services. At 
present, the machine vision services in the 
on-site network require the addition of 
dedicated industrial computers and servers, 
resulting in the complexity of on-site 
networking.
To address these issues, industrial base 
stations provide an integrated computing 
and network solution that decouples the 
computing and I/O of PLCs through the 
virtualization technology (Fig. 1). This 
allows the PLCs, machine vision, big data, 
and other services to share the computing 
platforms based on general hardware 
computing power. Additionally, the PLC IO 
function can be extended to the industrial 
gateway, which, together with the intrinsic 
determination capability of industrial base 
stations, normalizes the IT and OT networks 
to achieve /f_lat networking on the site. This 
facilitates collaboration and interaction of 
on-site devices, achieving multi-service 
integration and collaboration.
Conclusion
Driven by policies and technologies, 
there is a growing trend towards the 
convergence and normalization of OT and 
IT in the on-site network /f_ield. ZTE's 5G 
Binjiang Factory in Nanjing has been 
exploring the application of the 5G 
industrial /f_ield network solution in intelligent manufacturing. On the QCell 
assembly line, an on-site network service 
platform has been built using the industrial 
base station solution and the 5G industrial 
gateway. This platform enables uni/f_ied 
access management of southbound devices 
and buses in the OT domain, and IT 
services such as virtual PLC runtime 
environment and computer vision 
detection. This platform also provides 
machine vision applications, including the 
logic control of the manufacturing line and 
electronic fence, as well as northbound 
data interface services.
The 5G industrial base station solution 
makes full use of the bene/f_its of 5G 
networks and address issues such as many 
layers of industrial Ethernet networks, 
many fault points, and service adjustment 
diï¬ƒculty. This solution enables wireless PLC 
and allows production control to shift from 
PLC local multi-point, and discrete 
management to centralized and integrated 
management. It facilitates the transition of 
business logic from the non-compatible 
and closed ecological mode of traditional 
PLC manufacturers to the software-based 
and open ecological mode of cloud-based 
PLC. Thus, the industrial site network 
evolves from silos and OT local control to 
OICT integration that allows for /f_lexible 
manufacturing and digital and intelligent 
production.Fig. 1. Industrial
