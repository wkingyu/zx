has been widely adopted in port 
scenarios. However, for the remote 
driving of RTGC in the port, the 5G 
network still faces the following 
challenges: the large uplink 
bandwidth caused by the backhaul 
of multiple HD videos, the low 
network latency and high reliability 
required by the two-way transmitting 
and receiving of control commands, 
and the concurrent services caused 
by the remote control of multiple 
RTGCs at the same time. ZTE’s 
port-oriented 5G remote driving 
solution now is at the forefront of 
the industry and has overcome the 
above diﬃculties by introducing key 
technologies and solutions such as 
SuperMIMO, SuperCell, I-frame 
collision elimination, frame 
replication and elimination for 
reliability (FRER), and local traﬃc 
oﬄoad function (TOF) based on 
NodeEngine, a base station with 
embedded computing engine.
The real-time backhaul of HD 
videos of RTGC remote control 
requires a network with large 
uplink bandwidth capability. 
Generally, there are two to four RTGCs deployed in a 400-meter 
container area, and each RTGC has 
four to six HD video cameras for 
video backhaul. Therefore, there are 
totally 24-channel HD videos at the 
same time. Considering the probability 
of I-frame collision, the maximum 
uplink instantaneous rate can 
reach over 250 Mbps. Taking the 
bandwidth of 100M in the 3.5G 
band of ITU as an example, an 
uplink bandwidth of 180–200 Mbps 
can be provided in practical 
applications, which cannot fully 
meet the transmission requirement. 
ZTE’s SuperMIMO can eliminate cell 
boundaries through the multiple-
input multiple-output antenna 
technology and improve spectrum 
resource utilization through the space 
division multiplexing technology. The 
maximum cell capacity can be 
increased by four times, eﬀectively 
meeting the requirement for large 
uplink bandwidth for HD video 
backhaul of RTGC.
The transmission of remote 
control commands for RTGC 
requires a network with very low 
latency and very high reliability.
