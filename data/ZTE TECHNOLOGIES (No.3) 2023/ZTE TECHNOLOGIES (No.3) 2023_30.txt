which has a great impact on 
positioning measurement. At the 
same time, there are many hollow 
areas, so vertical dimension should 
be taken into account in 
positioning. For various complex 
environments, positioning 
algorithms such as UTDOA, AOA 
and ECID are adopted based on 5G 
networks and the environmental 
characteristics. Considering both 
cost and accuracy, traditional 
positioning technologies such as 
UWB, Bluetooth and satellite can 
be integrated for speci/f_ic areas. A 
variety of positioning technologies 
and algorithms work together to 
adapt to various scenarios, which 
provides a location foundation for  
the construction of enterprise 
personnel positioning management 
system.
The platform layer includes 
location-based service (LBS) and 
map service. LBS provides location 
calculation based on measurement 
data at the network layer, and also located, the portability is of 
primacy. ZTE provides a variety 
of 5G positioning terminals such 
as mobile phones and safety 
helmets with communication 
capabilities. It also provides card 
terminals adopting Bluetooth 
and UWB. With the launch of 5G 
RedCap positioning chips, more 
5G lightweight, low-power and 
low-cost terminals will come out, 
and 5G positioning will adapt to 
more scenarios.
The network layer, which 
completes positioning 
measurement and provides the 
basis for location services, can be 
based on a variety of positioning 
algorithms of 5G cellular, and can 
also extend traditional positioning 
algorithms to adapt to various 
scenarios. For example, in chemical 
plant areas, steel factories and 
other steel-structure places, there 
are many large metal equipment 
and brackets; in this environment, 
the signal obstruction is serious,
