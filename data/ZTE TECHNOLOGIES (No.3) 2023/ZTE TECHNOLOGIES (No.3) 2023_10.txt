5G Provides a Multi-layer Fully-Connected 
Network
In the network construction of traditional 
factories, the typical approach is to /f_irst 
establish a “campus network” at the factory 
level. This campus network serves to 
enable the factory’s IT network and some 
production networks to move to clouds. It 
oﬀers broad coverage and is often shared 
with public user networks. 
As the connection /f_ield extends to the 
“shop-/f_loor level” and “production-line 
level”, the “campus network” based on the 
sharing mode is no longer applicable. The 
most important problems to be solved at 
the shop-/f_loor and production-line levels 
are the reliable connection in the OT 
domain and the “/f_ield network” deployed 
with local computing power. Unlike the 
“campus network” that aims to solve all 
connection problems with a single network, the “/f_ield network” is customized 
for speci/f_ic OT domain services. Therefore, 
there will be multiple customized “/f_ield 
networks” to accomodate diﬀerent types 
of OT domain scenarios. 
The 5G network provides abundant 
networking frameworks. For the “campus 
network”, a networking approach 
compatible with the operator’s network 
can be adopted, with UPF deployed inside 
the campus. For the “/f_ield network”, an 
integrated hyper-converged networking 
mode can be used, and the networking is 
completed locally in the shop/f_loor or 
production line.
