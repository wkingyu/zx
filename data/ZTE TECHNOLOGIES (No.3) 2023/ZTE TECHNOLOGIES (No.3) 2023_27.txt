user simultaneous access. The solution splits 
traﬃc based on the rules such as PLMN, 
S-NSSAI and destination IP addresses, and 
meets the access requirements of both 
4G/5G B2B and B2C services, achieving 
the goal of keeping B2B traﬃc data 
within the enterprise campus and 
enabling B2C users to access both the 
Internet and the local enterprise intranet 
simultaneously (Fig. 2).
Delay Reduction and Service Experience 
Optimization
Compared to using a public VPN to 
access internal services such as industrial 
applications and online training, adopting 
the 5G dual-domain private network 
solution based on NodeEngine can 
greatly shorten the access path and 
reduce the service access delay. In 
addition, 5G realizes indoor and outdoor 
continuous coverage with larger capacity, 
stronger interference resistance, and 
better mobility. This one-hop direct 
access greatly improves service 
experience over traditional public 
VPN access.data network name (DNN) of a public 
network without terminal awareness, 
resulting in good user experience.
Users in the traﬃc oﬄoad area 
(campus or home area) can access 
both the enterprise intranet and the 
Internet simultaneously. 
Users can continue to access the 
Internet while roaming without the 
need to route Internet traﬃc back to 
their home location. 
There are also some constraints in the 
ULCL oﬄoading solution:
Campus services do not support 
access via 4G networks and roaming 
scenarios. Due to the lack of support 
for ULCL functionality in 4G scenarios 
and incomplete support in roaming 
scenarios in the 3GPP protocol, 
campus users are unable to access the 
enterprise intranet through ULCL while 
in 4G coverage. 
Terminals in the campus are planned 
by the operator as B2C users. 
Therefore, IP address con/f_licts may 
occur when interconnecting with the 
campus. To avoid con/f_licts, network 
address translation (NAT) isolation is 
required. 
5G Dual-Domain Private Network 
Solution Based on NodeEngine
ZTE’s NodeEngine-based 5G dual-
domain private network solution is a 
simpli/f_ied private network solution for 
campuses, hospitals and industrial parks. 
The solution can rapidly provide industrial 
private network services only by 
deploying one computing board in the 
existing BBU, which signi/f_icantly reduces 
deployment costs and shortens 
deployment cycles.
By adding this computing board, the 
NodeEngine-based 5G dual-domain 
private network solution enables 4G/5G
