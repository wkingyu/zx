which means that the same signal is 
sent to NodeEngine through two 
diﬀerent frequencies on the edge 
gateway, and the FRER software 
selects the optimal receiving signal. 
This greatly reduces the risk of 
dependence on the signal quality 
from a single frequency. At the same 
time, the FRER function based on 
diﬀerent frequencies also avoids the 
problem of simultaneous cell 
handover on diﬀerent frequencies  in 
the overlapped coverage area, and 
solves the pain points of RTGC 
remote driving when crossing a road 
between diﬀerent container areas in 
the yard. In addition, the local traﬃc 
oﬄoad function of NodeEngine can 
quickly oﬄoad RTGC remote driving 
traﬃc from the base station side to 
the local campus, avoiding the traﬃc 
passing through the core network 
UPF, thereby reducing the network 
latency to less than 10 ms. The local 
traﬃc oﬄoad function of NodeEngine 
and the traﬃc oﬄoad function of the 
core network UPF can inter-backup 
to increase the robustness of the 
network.
ZTE’s 5G-based remote driving 
solution is being trialed and veri/f_ied 
in some ports in China. This 
technology can be used not only for 
remote driving of RTGC, but also for 
remote driving of RMGC, quayside 
container crane (QC) and intelligent 
guided vehicle (IGV) in the ports. In 
addition, as a universal remote 
control technology, the 5G-based 
remote driving solution can also be 
widely used for remote control of 
electric traveling crane in steel and 
metallurgy, as well as remote driving 
of unmanned mining trunk in mines. 
This solution has a wide application 
prospect.
Generally, the bidirectional 
transmission delay of control 
commands is required to be less 
than 20 ms, and the reliability is 
required to be above 99.99%. This 
is a challenge for conventional 5G 
coverage. Especially when a RTGC 
travels at the edge of a cell or 
frequently switches between 
multiple cells, the signal quality 
may be degraded, which may 
increase the transmission time and 
retransmission times of control 
commands signi/f_icantly, and the 
quality of service may be aﬀected 
in a severe case. The SuperCell 
technology provided by ZTE can 
eliminate inter-cell interference, 
expand cell coverage, reduce cell 
handover times, and greatly meet 
the low latency and high reliability 
requirements of control commands 
by combining multiple adjacent 
cells into a logical cell.
Moreover, ZTE’s unique NodeEngine, 
self-developed function software, 
and industrial grade edge gateway 
can enhance the 5G capability for 
RTGC remote driving. For example, 
the I frame collision cancellation 
technology is used for video 
optimization. By optimizing video 
encoding and decoding algorithms 
on the edge gateway, the periodic 
I-frame design can be cancelled. 
Alternatively, an AI application can 
be deployed on NodeEngine to 
identify the cameras with I-frame 
collisions and provide suggestions 
on adjusting the I-frame period, so 
as to greatly reduce the instantaneous 
impact of video on network 
bandwidth. For control commands, 
the FRER technology is used to 
realize the function of dual-
transmission and optimal-receiving,
