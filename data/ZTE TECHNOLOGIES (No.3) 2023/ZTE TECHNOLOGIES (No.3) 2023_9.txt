fragmented data makes it diﬃcult for 
enterprises to accumulate digital assets, 
hindering process optimization and 
iterative improvements. 
5G Empowers the Industrial Internet
The introduction of 5G oﬀers 
eﬀective solutions to the challenges 
encountered by the industrial Internet. 
In terms of connectivity, 5G simpli/f_ies 
the traditional /f_ive-layer architecture of 
the industrial Internet into three layers (Fig. 1), facilitating the integration of 
data silos. Regarding networking, the 
new 5G network architecture provides a 
level of reliability and stability on par 
with industrial Ethernet, ensuring 
seamless operation in the core OT 
domain of industrial production. 
Furthermore, 5G inherently possesses 
cloud-edge synergy capabilities, 
allowing enterprises to independently 
deploy applications and resolve the 
problem of fragmented data from 
industrial control manufacturers. The industrial Internet is the central component 
among various elements in the application of 
5G in factories. It directly serves the IT and OT 
business systems of enterprises, while the 5G 
network plays a crucial role in ensuring its 
smooth operation.
