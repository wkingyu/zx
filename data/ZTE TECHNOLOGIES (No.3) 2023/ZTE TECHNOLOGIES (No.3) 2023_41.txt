this 5G private network, including 
"5G+ intelligent iron and steel control 
platform" and "unmanned overhead 
travelling crane". 
The iron and steel industry involves 
various stages such as material selection, 
ironmaking, steelmaking, continuous 
casting, rolling steel, energy & 
environmental management, logistics 
management, and quality management. 
However, the IT level of the industry 
varies widely, and many links still rely 
on manual operations, resulting in low 
production eﬃciency. In response, China 
Baowu has been promoting industrial 
intelligence since 2019. Meanwhile, with 
the arrival of 5G era, China Baowu is 
focusing on using 5G networks for 
eﬃcient production, safe production, 
energy saving, consumption reduction, 
and high-value equipment guarantee. 
They also aim to develop more 
diversified 5G+ industrial Internet 
applications. uhan Iron and Steel 
(Group) Corporation 
was the first super-
large iron and steel 
complex established after the 
founding of the  People's Republic of 
China in 1949. In 2016, it merged with 
Baosteel Group Corporation Limited 
to form the China Baowu Steel Group 
Corporation Limited, which is now 
the country’s most modern and 
competitive iron and steel joint 
enterprise and the world’s leading 
modern steel conglomerate. 
Since 2021, Wuhan Unicom, ZTE, 
and Wuhan Iron and Steel Company 
Limited (known as WISCO) have 
worked together to build a 5G 
full-connected factory, which is the 
first project to deploy dedicated 
5G core network and transport 
network in the enterprise campus 
in Hubei Province. Six applications
