n the past decade, China has made 
signi/f_icant progress in intelligent 
manufacturing, but most enterprises 
are still in the early stage of 
transformation towards intelligence. At the end 
of 2021, the equipment networking rate of 
industrial manufacturing enterprises in China 
was only 28.78%, the automatic data collection 
rate for production was 40.1%, and the full-
process quality traceability was only 16.97%. A 
large number of production elements such as 
personnel, machinery, materials, methods, 
environment, and measurement have not 
yet been interconnected. To achieve the 
networking of a large number of dumb 
devices on the production site, signi/f_icant 
changes are required for the existing 
industrial Ethernet and /f_ield buses based on 
wired technology. These changes involve 
adding ports and devices, rewiring, and 
recon/f_iguration, which entail a large and 
complex workload, a long cycle, high costs, 
and a signi/f_icant impact on production.
However, by seamlessly integrating 5G /f_ield 
networks with existing industrial networks, 
intelligent upgrading and transformation of 
industrial enterprises can become smoother, 
faster, lower-cost, and more eﬃcient in 
operation.
What’s 5G Field Network
5G Field network refers to a 5G network 
deployed in production sites such as production 
lines and shop/f_loors, connecting production 
elements of people, machines, materials, methods, environment and measurement to 
achieve local real-time closed-loop processing 
of applications in core production domain 
such as data acquisition, industrial control and 
production management. This network is also 
integrated with operational, information and 
communication technologies (OICT). As the 
application of 5G in the industrial enterprises 
has gradually expanded from peripheral 
production assistance to core production 
control, the 5G /f_ield network will accelerate 
the pace of 5G deep into the core production 
control and make industrial manufacturing 
/f_lexible, digital and intelligent.
Solution
Taking into account the industry characteristics 
such as local real-time closed-loop processing 
of OT business /f_low in production lines or 
shop/f_loors, short production cycle, automatic 
connection of process /f_low, and frequent 
adjustment of /f_lexible manufacturing lines, ZTE 
has developed a 5G /f_ield network solution that 
integrates terminals, network, cloud, applications 
and maintenance (Fig. 1). This solution provides 
a one-stop, low-latency, low-jitter, and high-
availability deterministic wireless network for 
the core production business, meeting the 
needs of /f_lexible, digital/uni00A0 and intelligent upgrade 
of industrial manufacturing.
The 5G /f_ield network oﬀers the following 
bene/f_its:
