factories, and shop/f_loors.
Bluetooth and UWB have small 
positioning distance and need 
many hardware devices, resulting 
in high cost and complex 
maintenance. The construction in 
critical scenarios must be strictly 
approved, and it is diﬃcult for 
on-site construction personnel to 
wire and obtain electricity, 
resulting in a long project 
construction period.
Traditional Bluetooth, UWB and 
satellite positioning systems only 
focus on positioning capabilities, 
and cannot take into account 
the large-bandwidth wireless 
networks required for digital 
transformation of enterprises.
Facing the positioning 
requirements of critical scenarios, 
ZTE and upstream and downstream 
location service partners have 
insight into industry needs and 
scene characteristics, integrate a 
variety of positioning technologies, 
and build a 5G hybrid positioning 
solution based on 5G private 
networks.
As shown in Fig. 1, the 5G hybrid 
positioning solution is divided into 
four layers: terminal layer, network 
layer, platform layer, and service 
layer.
Regarding the terminal layer, 
where the measured object is nterprise safety and 
production are closely 
related and inseparable, 
and safe production is 
the basis of enterprise development. 
Especially in the hazardous 
industries, there are many 
dangerous operating environments, 
such as furnaces and stockyards in 
steel plants, and /f_lammable and 
explosive chemical installation 
areas. Accidents occur frequently, 
which cannot guarantee the safety 
of personnel, let alone safety in 
production.
To implement safe production 
and ensure the safety of personnel, 
it is necessary to make the 
location of personnel visible, 
hazardous areas manageable, and 
emergency response controllable. 
Many enterprises take safe 
production as their /f_irst priority, 
and begin to build a personnel 
positioning management system. 
Traditional positioning is mainly 
based on satellites, Bluetooth, 
UWB and other positioning 
technologies. Based on these 
positioning technologies, 
enterprises face the following 
problems in their choices:
Satellite deteriorates its 
positioning accuracy due 
to obstruction, such as in the 
middle of multiple buildings 
or indoor areas of oﬃces, 5G Hybrid Positioning Solutions:
