ensure enterprises have a better 
service experience. ZTE has actively 
worked with partners to build and 
improve the solutions and gradually 
promote their maturity. 
5G cellular positioning:  ZTE 
has completed end-to-end 
commercial trials of 5G cellular 
positioning technology in 
diﬀerent scenarios such as 
industrial manufacturing, 
transportation hubs, chemical 
parks, and hospitals.
5G+UWB deep integration: 
ZTE has carried out in-depth 
cooperation with industry-
leading UWB enterprises, taking 
the lead in launching 5G+UWB 
deep integration solutions and 
promoting commercial trials and 
implementation.
Interface standardization: 
ZTE has worked with industry 
chain partners to promote the 
standardization of location 
service interfaces, and has 
completed the integration with 
multiple business applications.
5G terminal form:  ZTE has 
promoted terminal partners 
to enrich 5G terminal types.
ZTE will continue to work closely 
with partners to further promote the 
development of the 5G end-to-end 
industry chain, provide all-scenario 
5G hybrid positioning solution for 
complex and hazardous scenarios, 
and promote the rapid implementation 
of positioning management systems. 
The solution will become one of the 
strong supports for 5G-enabled 
vertical industries, empowering 
enterprise security management 
and facilitating their digital 
transformation.provides basic location and 
trajectory analysis. Map service is 
used for closed parks or indoor 
places, providing map production 
rendering and location information 
presentation. It can choose 
centralized or distributed 
deployment methods according to 
the enterprise’s existing cloud-edge 
architecture or its own distribution.
The service layer, which is the 
enterprise’s service portal, provides 
enterprise-oriented application 
services, and is a part of the 
enterprise digital platform, 
including personnel management, 
vehicle management, electronic 
attendance, and electronic fence. It 
can also be combined with the 
digital twin technology to fully 
perceive people, equipment and 
environment, establish an eﬃcient 
connection under the complex 
environment of the enterprise, and 
combine the operation of factory 
production system with the 
enterprise personnel positioning 
management system. The service 
layer and the platform layer are 
decoupled to be /f_lexibly integrated. 
The digital platform of the 
enterprise can directly call the 
platform layer for application 
service presentation, or directly use 
the open location data of the 
platform layer to provide location 
services for the enterprise as 
required.
Enterprise-oriented location 
services need to consider map 
construction and end-to-end 
system integration, and also need 
to provide end-to-end positioning 
solutions in the /f_ields of terminal, 
network, platform, map, and 
application integration, so as to
