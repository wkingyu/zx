along the tube of waveguide 
fastened to the ground, and the 
WiFi signal leaks out through the 
gaps of the tube. This method 
avoids direct connection of 
cables, however, due to the weak 
leakage signal, RTGC must travel 
along and close to the tube, 
which limits its range of 
movement. In addition, the WiFi 
waveguide solution still has the 
following problems. First, the 
transmission distance of a 
waveguide is normally less than 
50 meters, and during travelling, 
RTGC needs to switch between 
diﬀerent waveguides, which may 
cause interruption of signal 
transmission. Second, when the 
signals of several RTGCs are 
transmitted in the same 
waveguide, the service quality 
may be degraded because of the 
con/f_lict mechanism of WiFi 
channels. Third, when a RTGC 
needs to be transferred between 
diﬀerent container areas and 
yards, the tube of waveguide 
cannot cross a road, and in this 
case, remote driving cannot be 
implemented.
For its large uplink bandwidth, 
low latency, high reliability, 
network slice isolation, and precise 
SLA guarantee, 5G has attracted 
the attention of port owners and  rubber tire gantry crane 
(RTGC) is an important 
vertical transport tool 
for container ports, 
implementing the turnover of 
containers in the yards. Currently, 
the driving of RTGC has evolved 
from on-site control in a narrow 
cabin hanging under RTGC to 
remote control in a spacious central 
operating room, which greatly 
improves the working conditions of 
the drivers (Fig. 1). However, remote 
driving brings a great challenge to 
network deployment. The network 
not only needs to meet the 
requirements of high-bandwidth 
and real-time transmission of 
multiple HD videos, extremely low 
latency and ultra-high reliability of 
control commands, but also the 
requirement for RTGC to move at a 
rate of 15 km/h.
In addition, unlike a rail 
mounted gantry crane (RMGC) 
travelling on a /f_ixed railway, RTGC 
does not run in a full straight line, 
and more importantly, RTGC needs 
to be transferred between diﬀerent 
container areas and yards, so the 
wired connection based on /f_iber 
can’t be adopted.
At present, a typical solution in 
the industry is to use the WiFi 
network based on a waveguide, that 
is, the WiFi signal is transmitted A
