operation domain will bring greater value 
for operators and increase user stickiness. 
Whether the 5G campus network could 
ful/f_ill the /f_ield applications? Actually, /f_ield 
applications have three unique demands. 
First, they have extreme requirements for 
determinism. The existing performance 
capabilities of the campus network depend 
on the public network, making it diﬃcult to 
apply various strict assurance measures. 
Second, /f_ield applications need closed-loop 
data. That means the generation, receiving 
and processing of data must be closed-loop 
on the /f_ield to ensure continuity and 
security. However, the campus network 
relies on remote public clouds or is closed-loop at the campus level, making it 
challenging to match local close-loop 
requirements. Furthermore, some /f_ield 
networks, especially production-line 
network, need to be pre-integrated by 
integrators in advance. The campus network 
serves multiple services and even public 
subscribers, so it can’t match the 
pre-integration and migration requirements 
of production lines. Therefore, serving /f_ield 
applications directly using the campus 
network is diﬃcult. To better serve the 
manufacturing process, we recommend 
overlaying /f_ield networks on the basis of a 
5G campus network, i.e., a“1+N hierarchical 
5G private network” (Fig. 1) .
