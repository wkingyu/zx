In addition, in emergency scenarios, the 
solution oﬀers a one-click shutdown feature 
to quickly take content oﬄine, minimizing the 
negative impact of unauthorized content. It also 
provides a one-click reset function for TVOD 
to reset any on-compliant content, ensuring 
compliance and security.
Service Security
To ensure the security of CDN services, ZTE 
secure CDN solution oﬀers security protection 
in terms of user service, service quality, source 
legitimacy, and node disaster recovery. These 
security measures provide reliable protection 
and support for CDN services.  
User service anti-hotlink protection:  User 
requests are encrypted using algorithms such 
as AES or MD5 to prevent unauthorized access 
or hotlinking. 
Service quality protection:  By utilizing 
forward error correction (FEC) for live 
streaming, the solution ensures user viewing 
quality even in scenarios with a 2% packet loss, 
without introducing any additional latency. 
Additionally, the automatic repeat-request 
(ARQ) technology for VOD enables automatic 
retransmission of lost packets, ensuring 
optimal user experience even in situations 
with a 5% packet loss. 
Fraudulent website alert:  The system for 
detecting fraudulent websites leverages big 
data resources and advanced technologies 
to build a precise and eﬃcient system for 
technical blocking and countermeasures. attacks, abnormal login, reverse shell, and local 
privilege escalation.  
Service security:  By utilizing the operating 
system kernel protection technology, ZTE 
secure CDN solution monitors and protects 
the content in CDN servers in real time to 
prevent unauthorized tampering. The solution 
incorporates remote disaster recovery and 
anti-hotlink protection technologies to 
safeguard service security within CDN servers. 
Additionally, the data masking technology is 
also used to prevent the disclosure of sensitive 
data stored in CDN servers. 
Content Security
The CDN host server primarily consists of VOD 
content, live streaming content, TSTV and TVOD, 
and database. ZTE secure CDN solution protects 
the security of the content within CDN from the 
three aspects: 
Local content tampering prevention:  Using 
the operating system kernel event-triggering 
technology, the solution protects the security 
of the content stored in CDN host servers. 
Content distribution tempering prevention: 
Comparing feature values of the /f_iles, the 
solution safeguards the security of VOD 
content distributed between CDN nodes.
Live streaming tempering prevention:  
Implementing tamper-proo/f_ing for streaming 
media based on I-frame and for HLS content 
based on TS /f_ile feature values, the solution 
ensures the security of live content distributed 
between CDN nodes.
