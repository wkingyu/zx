ccording to the Paris Agreement, 
global carbon emissions need to 
be reduced by 45% by 2030. To 
achieve this goal, governments 
and organizations worldwide have introduced 
various eco-friendly policies and regulations. 
The telecom industry should play a signi/f_icant 
role in this eﬀort by prioritizing energy 
conservation through enhanced eﬃciency and 
minimizing technology-related emissions. It is 
crucial for enterprises to realize that sustainable 
development is not only an act of public welfare, 
but also closely related to their long-term survival.
ZTE’s Journey Towards Green Business
Environmental conservation and reducing 
carbon emissions have emerged as shared 
responsibilities among countries and enterprises 
around the globe. ZTE, throughout the entire 
process spanning from ideation and planning 
to development, validation, production and 
operational management, has consistently 
prioritized environmental protection and carbon 
emission reduction, with clear implementation 
measures in place. 
ZTE’s set-top box (STB) products are fully 
compliant with international environmental 
standards such as CE, REACH and RoHS to ensure 
quality control. According to CE certi/f_ication, ZTE 
needs to provide environmental test reports or 
assessment reports for its products, and add 
product recycling manuals to the product 
development output, while meeting customers’ 
environmental certi/f_ication requirements such as 
ULE certi/f_ication. ZTE has been complying with 
relevant laws and regulations and environmental 
standards, taking into account customer needs 
and recyclable designs. In the operation and 
management sector, it develops recycling manuals, transforms network infrastructure, and 
implements reverse logistics processes including 
product returns, material substitution, reuse, 
waste disposal, repair, and remanufacturing to 
enhance the environmental eﬃciency of 
enterprises.
Through continuous eﬀorts over the past 
/f_ifteen years, ZTE has signi/f_icantly enhanced 
its capabilities in environmentally friendly 
production, earning recognition and certi/f_ication 
in the /f_ield of environmental protection. Each STB 
product is separately tested according to speci/f_ic 
requirements to ensure that its commitment 
meets and exceeds the relevant standards.
ZTE’s Pursuit of Ultimate Green 
Production
ZTE believes that the adoption of 
environmentally friendly materials is essential to 
its sustainable development. From product 
design to material selection, and throughout the 
entire lifecycle, ZTE always sticks to the principle 
of sustainable development. By opting for 
innovative recyclable materials, the company 
reduces carbon emissions and achieves 
sustainable utilization of resources.
95% PCR Plastic Casing 
The utilization of 95% polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) plastic is a predominant practice in 
the industry. However, increasing the proportion 
of recycled plastic may result in degraded material 
performance, aﬀecting aspects such as infrared 
light projection. Compared to new materials, the 
mechanical properties of PCR materials exhibit 
minimal diﬀerences, including lower impact 
strength and elongation at break. From a product 
structural perspective, excessive PCR content can Going Greener with Energy
