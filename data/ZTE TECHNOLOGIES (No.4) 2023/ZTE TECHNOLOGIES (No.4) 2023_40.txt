Mainstream content-rich ecosystems such as

in developing IP-based services and a hybrid 
model of DVB+OTT, as this has become the 
prevailing trend.

Pay TV Background
The traditional digital TV market in Latin 
America has reached its saturation point, with 
limited room for additional growth. However, 
there is still a signi/f_icant number of users who 
rely on standard de/f_inition (SD) set-top boxes 
(STBs). Therefore, the conversion from SD to high 
de/f_inition (HD) will become a crucial turning point 
for the traditional digital TV business, especially in 
countries with relatively low HD penetration, such 
as Colombia, Chile, and Central America. 
The traditional digital TV market is highly 
competitive, with a narrow range of content 
oﬀerings. The average revenue per user (ARPU) 
has been declining year by year, imposing 
considerable operational cost pressures on 
operators. Therefore, reducing operational 
costs is a pressing issue for these operators.
