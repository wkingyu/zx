such as abnormal login, backdoors, local 
privilege escalation, malicious scanning, 
malicious processes, and brute-force attacks. It 
also includes proactive defense against CSRF 
attacks, deserialization attacks, /f_ile upload 
attacks, SQL injection attacks, and other attack 
behaviors.  
Security O&M:  The host security O&M 
subsystem monitors various security states 
on CDN host devices, including abnormal 
processes, operations, account activities, and 
other exceptional conditions.
Future Product Planning
To improve the security and governance 
capabilities of CDN, it is recommended to adopt 
systematic defense and digital operations for 
product planning. This involves building a layered 
defense system through capability stacking and 
using digital metrics to drive security operations, 
thereby enhancing the practical eﬀectiveness of 
CDN’s security protection. The future secure CDN 
planning will focus on the following three aspects: 
Building a unified security platform to 
simplify management:  Integrating CDN 
security products with a uni/f_ied design 
concept, including platform integration, 
functional integration, and management 
integration. This can signi/f_icantly simplify 
the complexity of CDN system construction, 
operation and expansion.
Implementing a layered defense system 
for manageable security risks:  Optimizing 
closed-loop defense strategies against security 
threats, and planning based on prevention, 
protection, detection and response. This 
enables eﬀective defense against both known 
and unknown security threats, signi/f_icantly 
reducing security risks.  
Providing security operation tools to 
improve CDN security intelligence: Providing 
methods and tools for security operations 
to present CDN security eﬀects in real time. 
This enables targeted analysis of current 
weaknesses and facilitates the improvement 
of CDN security management maturity and 
intelligence level as needed. Its goal is to prevent fraudulent calls, block 
fraudulent messages, restrict access to 
fraudulent websites, and prevent fraudulent 
money transfers. 
Node disaster recovery:  By utilizing 
various disaster recovery technologies 
including Anycast scheduling, private 
network redundancy for live streaming, 
source redundancy for live streaming, and 
active/standby platform, the solution ensures 
uninterrupted service of CDN nodes even in 
abnormal scenarios. 
Data Security
Sensitive data such as IP addresses, user names, 
passwords, and email addresses are stored in 
CDN. To prevent the disclosure of sensitive user 
data, secure CDN provides a visual management 
interface for data masking con/f_iguration. It 
adopts AES256 reversible encryption algorithm 
and SHA256+ SALT irreversible algorithm to 
mask sensitive data, eﬀectively preventing data 
disclosure within the CDN. 
Host Security
To ensure the security of the CDN host, a 
comprehensive approach is implemented. 
Initially, a thorough assessment of CDN hardware 
and software assets is conducted to identify 
potential vulnerabilities and ensure compliance. 
Subsequently, proactive measures are taken 
for attack defense and detection. Finally, a 
traceability analysis is performed to establish an 
integrated host security defense system. 
Asset management:  This involves managing 
server basic information, processes, accounts, 
ports, network connections, and operating 
system. 
Risk detection:  This involves detecting 
risks within the host, such as backdoors, 
vulnerabilities, weak passwords, trojans, and 
abnormal /f_iles. By identifying these abnormal 
risks in the host, the system triggers alerts to 
initiate further inspection.
Intrusion detection and defense:  This 
involves detecting and alerting on threats
