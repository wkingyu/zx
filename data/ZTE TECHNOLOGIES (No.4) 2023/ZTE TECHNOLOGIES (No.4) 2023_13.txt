their viewing habits.
The second challenge is the unattractive 
UI design of IPTV platforms. TV interaction 
is not user-friendly, and linear TV leads to

have little interest in watching TV.

address these challenges. With increasingly 
diverse entertainment options and rapidly 
changing user habits, there is not much time for TV to adapt. Here are some discussions on
