Smart media processing system:  It is 
deployed in the central access oﬃce, 
responsible for enhanced processing 
on received videos, including protocol 
conversion, identi/f_ication, aggregation, 
transformation, and enhancement. 
These processes aim to generate 
scenario-oriented video media streams. 
UHD CDN: It is also deployed in 
the central access oﬃce. Its main 
responsibilities include distributing and 
storing media content. It ensures that 
videos are distributed to the required 
locations and stored or cached based on 
demand. 
Terminal video playback:  It involves 
integrating the multi-dimensional video 
SDK into the terminal app. The terminal 
app connects to the video distribution 
network, decodes the media streams, and 
renders them according to the scenario 
for seamless playback.
The smart spectator business scenario 
primarily includes innovative videos 
such as frame-synchronized MVV, VR, 
FVV, and virtual viewpoint. It relies on 
advanced technologies such as full 
Gigabit network, video capture, encoding, 
broadcasting, storage and transmission, as 
well as terminal decoding and rendering 
techniques, to deliver a higher-de/f_inition, 
multi-dimensional, and interactive viewing 
experience. By leveraging cutting-edge 
video technologies, it adds vitality to 
large-scale events and activities, increasing 
the viewers’ sense of immersion and 
engagement. placed around the venue is limited due to 
place or cost constraints. As a result, users 
may experience visual jitters caused by 
large disparities between adjacent camera 
positions during viewpoint transitions. To 
solve this problem, AI synthesis technology 
can be applied between adjacent 
frames to generate N virtual viewpoints, 
eﬀectively /f_illing in the missing viewpoints 
and ensuring smoother and more /f_luid 
transitions in FVV and bullet time eﬀects. 
Smart Spectator Experience at World 
University Games 
ZTE’s multidimensional video products 
integrate the features of ultra-high 
de/f_inition, interactive, and AI-enhanced 
video capabilities to provide users with 
a brand-new experience. These products 
have been commercially deployed in 
various industries such as education, 
healthcare, sports, and tourism. One 
notable service is the smart spectator live 
broadcasting that supports MVV, FVV, and 
UHD VR content, catering to both on-site 
viewers using small screens and oﬀ-site 
viewers on large screens. In July 2023, the 
31st FISU Summer World University Games 
was held in Chengdu, China, and ZTE’s 
multi-dimensional video products played 
a crucial role in enhancing the smart 
spectator experience, providing innovative 
features like MVV, FVV, VR and virtual 
viewpoints.    
As shown in Fig. 1, the smart spectator 
system consists of four main parts: video 
capture and streaming adjustment, smart 
media processing system, UHD CDN, and 
terminal video playback.
Video capture and streaming 
adjustment: It involves deploying 
cameras at the venue to capture real-time 
video and encode it. The encoded video 
streams are then transmitted to the 
system through dedicated lines or reliable 
networks.
