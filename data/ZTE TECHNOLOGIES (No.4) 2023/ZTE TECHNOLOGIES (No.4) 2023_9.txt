bandwidth and greater transmit power of 
base stations. With continuous eﬀorts in this 
/f_ield, ZTE has achieved a power ampli/f_ier 
eﬃciency 8% higher than the industry average. 
Also, we use /f_lexible, optical backplanes for 
32-dimensional optical cross-connects (OXCs) 
to simplify equipment architecture while 
greatly enhancing network capacity and 
performance. To extend the range and reduce 
the penetration loss of millimeter wave, ZTE 
has used recon/f_igurable intelligent surface 
(RIS), to signi/f_icantly improve coverage, user 
experience, and deployment eﬃciency.
Regarding algorithm and architecture, ZTE's 
5G PowerPilot solution enables the energy 
saving of wireless networks by 35%, and this 
will reduce the power consumption of a single 
site to as low as 5 watts in sleep mode. Based 
on the algorithm for dynamic collaboration 
between base stations and RIS, our Dynamic 
RIS solution increases the millimeter wave 
coverage by 30% and the average downlink 
rate by six times. What's more, our distributed 
database solution, GoldenDB, can raise the 
performance and capacity of databases 
tenfold, and save 70% of investments via the 
decoupling of hardware and software.
For infrastructure and capability 
enhancement, the key lies in the network, engine of a car, chipsets are one of the most 
essential underlying technologies, which 
directly aﬀect the performance, integration, 
and power usage eﬀectiveness (PUE) of 
a product. In other major /f_ields such as 
computing facilities, 5G, data center switches, 
and terminals, there are higher expectations 
and requirements. Hence, we have made 
innovations and breakthroughs by taking 
various measures. For instance, advanced 
processes are adopted, and innovations 
are made in domain-speci/f_ic architecture 
(DSA), packaging, and systemic design, to 
prolong the Moore's Law. Also, we introduce 
heterogeneous computing to match diﬀerent 
scenarios, and therefore enhance performance 
and eﬃciency. Moreover, we achieve hardware 
acceleration based on DPUs and smart NICs, 
to constantly promote the co-optimization of 
software and hardware.
Innovations in components and materials, 
such as new power ampli/f_iers, /f_ilters, antenna 
elements, and heat dissipation design, can 
also create huge value. Take power ampli/f_iers 
as an example. Based on ETSI’s standard for 
measuring power consumption, with a 1% 
increase in power ampli/f_ier eﬃciency, the 
overall energy eﬃciency of equipment will 
rise by 1–2%, which will make possible larger
