maintenance brought about by the traditional siloed 
construction of mining communication networks, 
ZTE has proposed a solution: building a backbone 
transport network in mining areas to carry 
production services both above and under the mine. 
This involves constructing a physical ring network 
using metro transport network (MTN) hard slicing 
isolation technology, which provides multiple logical 
ring networks. These networks ensure service quality 
for various intelligent mining subsystems, oﬀering 
low latency, low jitter, high reliability, high security, 
and good scalability in transmitting data across 
complex coal mine environments through ring 
networking (Fig. 1).
 A pair of slicing packet network (SPN) 
convergence devices are used for core 
convergence, with SPN access devices above the 
mine and SPN CPEs under the mine. A 100G ring 
network or a 50G ring network is used above and 
under the mine respectively to form a transmission 
self-healing protection ring, intersecting at active 
and standby centers with a bandwidth of at least 
100 Gbps. The active and standby convergence 
nodes meet or exceed 2.0 level-3 information 
security standards, oﬀering uni/f_ied service 
interfaces for connection with data centers or 
oﬃce networks. Leveraging SPN’s low-delay 
feature, ring delay in the mining area is less 
than 1 ms, with multiple protection technologies 
like node protection, link protection, and 
active/standby redundancy, ensuring a highly 
reliable and intelligent mine backbone transmission system. 
To meet data transmission and service 
requirements for each service subsystem, the 100G 
SPN Ethernet ring network is divided into /f_ive slices: 
network per site, industrial video, integrated 
monitoring, industrial control, and 5G transmission 
(Fig. 2). These slice subsystems employ virtual routing 
forwarding (VRF) to isolate services, ensuring 
hardware isolation for diﬀerent service types and 
software isolation for identical service types. This 
approach guarantees reliable service transmission 
while facilitating classi/f_ied service management and 
access for diﬀerent service terminals. L2VPN over 
MPLS-TP tunnels or L3VPN over SR-TP tunnels can be 
selected based on service requirements and features 
to carry services. SPN convergence devices at both 
ends operate in hot or cold standby mode, with one 
end connected to a server for node protection. 
Within each slice, multiple PWs from the SPN access 
device at one end to the SPN convergence device at 
the same end can share the same tunnel, with tunnel 
protection con/f_igured. Network-side HQoS 
con/f_iguration is adjustable as required. 
Refer to Table 1 for bandwidth con/f_iguration and 
slice allocation details for service systems. The 
industrial video slice is allocated 30 Gbps bandwidth, 
the 5G transmission slice has 20 Gbps, and the 
remaining three slices each have 10 Gbps. 
Additionally, 20 Gbps bandwidth is reserved, 
allowing for /f_lexible allocation and adjustment of 
slice bandwidth as needed.
