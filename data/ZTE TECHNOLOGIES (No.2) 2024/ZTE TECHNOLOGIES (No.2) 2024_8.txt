he 14th Five-Year Plan marks a pivotal 
phase in China’s digital and intelligent 
transformation. The 5G+ industrial 
Internet will  drive innovation to 
develop new applications and ecosystems. Key 
sectors like power, transportation and railways will 
undergo gradual upgrades via private networks. 
The Ministry of Industry and Information 
Technology’s Industry Internet Innovation and 
Development Action Plan (2021–2023) outlines 
strategies supporting the advancement of “5G+ 
industrial Internet” and deploying new 
technologies such as deterministic networks. To 
develop high-quality 5G+ industrial Internet and 
private networks, the focus includes upgrading 
enterprise intranets, integrating IT with OT 
networks, building secure campus networks, 
establishing external networks for enterprises 
with high-performance, high-reliability, 
high-/f_lexibility and high-security network 
services, deploying new technologies such as 
cloud-network/computing-network convergence, 
deterministic networks, and IPv6 segment routing 
(SRv6), and promoting industrial access to 
high-quality external networks with a focus on data and network security. 
In collaboration with the China Academy of 
Information and Communications Technology 
(CAICT) and leading device manufacturers, China 
Mobile actively drives technological innovation 
and industrial applications in the slicing packet 
network (SPN) /f_ield for various industrial scenarios. 
The practical implementation of application 
solutions is underway in sectors like power, 
transportation, coal mines, ports, healthcare, and 
industrial campuses. In January 2023, the Research 
Report on the Requirements and Application of 
SPN in Industrial Scenarios was approved during 
the plenary session of the Industrial Internet 
Industry Alliance.
Transport Demand Analysis in Typical 
Industry Scenarios
Network transport demands diﬀer across 
various industry scenarios. For instance, in typical 
service scenarios like 5G+ industrial Internet and 
smart grids, Table 1 outlines variations in transport 
capabilities and index requirements for 
communication networks across eight service
