premium SPN private line, and the customized SPN 
private network, as shown in Fig. 1.
The main features of the basic SPN private line 
include shared slices, ubiquitous access, and rapid 
provisioning. Services are carried on industry-speci/f_ic 
private line slices, which are hard-isolated from the 
larger public network slices dedicated to ToC services. 
Soft isolation between private line services is 
implemented through a VPN network. Standard 
functions include multiple protection mechanisms 
and SLA visibility, while optional functions include 
provisioning progress visibility and topology 
visualization.
The premium SPN private line features /f_ine 
granularity and high isolation. Services are carried 
through /f_ine-granularity interfaces or channels, and 
isolation between services is achieved through 
/f_ine-granularity hard slices. This meets the 
requirements for service isolation, deterministic 
latency, and security. Additionally,  functions such as 
rerouting and network manageability, controllability, 
and visibility can be provided. 
The customized SPN private network oﬀers 
integrated network services tailored to speci/f_ic 
industries such as medical, education, and power. 
Diﬀerent service levels can be provided within a 
private network slice as required, with the slice being  
externally hard-isolated from other slices.
The SPN private line provides customers with an 
exclusive slice network, including soft slices, hard slices, 
and end-to-end channels. It ful/f_ills high-bandwidth, 
high-burst service transport requirements while also 
addressing low-latency, low-jitter service demands. 
Additionally, it oﬀers multiple layers of protection 
through mechanisms like rerouting and escape routing, 
along with various network self-service options.
rivate lines are an important service 
provided by telecommunications 
operators. However, traditional private 
lines face several challenges. These 
lines often come with a long provisioning period, 
failing to meet the enterprise’s agile provisioning 
and e-commerce requirements, lack transparency in 
network service quality, and are often outdated, 
leading to slow fault handling. Furthermore, the 
presence of various network standards results in 
high overall network construction and maintenance 
costs. Performance factors such as bandwidth and 
latency are in urgent need of improvement. The 
gradual phasing out of SDH equipment necessitates 
the replenishment of hard slicing network 
capabilities. New services such as 5G ToB private lines 
and enterprise-to-cloud have brought about new 
demands, including network security and 
programmability features.
In June 2022, China Mobile unveiled the slicing 
packet network (SPN) private line solution to address 
the aforementioned issues. This oﬀering provides a 
cost-eﬀective solution for industry sectors, featuring 
high isolation, /f_lexible bandwidth, deterministic 
latency, network visibility, and intelligent operation & 
maintenance. Additionally, it supports multi-purpose 
use, reducing costs and improving eﬃciency, thus 
meeting the diﬀerentiated, higher requirements 
posed by digital transformation for private line 
services.
