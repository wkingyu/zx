With hard slices deployed at a minimum granularity 
of 10 Mbps, bandwidth requirements for power 
services can be met, allowing the 5G VPN to achieve 
9 ms end-to-end average latency, zero packet loss, 
over 99.999% reliability, and synchronous timing 
accuracy error of less than 500 ns (meeting the 1 µs 
requirement of power services). The SPN FGU 
establishes a secure and eﬃcient communication 
management channel with deterministic latency 
and jitter for power services, laying a solid 
foundation for SPN network to transport power 
services and achieve widespread commercial use in 
the power industry.

power distribution automation. This environment 
encompassed a 5G wireless network, core network, 
and transport network in Jiangbei New District, 
Nanjing City, China. 
In this test, the core network used a dedicated UPF 
to carry power services, while the SPN transport 
network employed ZTE’s ZXCTN6700 core 
aggregation device and ZXCTN6180H access layer 
device. Results show that SPN /f_ine-grained slices  
isolate power control and protection services 
securely. Unlike shared slices for group customers, 
/f_ine-grained slices remain unaﬀected by congested 
/f_lows and have hard isolation capabilities of SDH. Scheme
