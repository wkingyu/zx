Recognized by ITU-T, SPN has achieved a 
large-scale deployment of over 340,000 nodes on 
China Mobile’s 5G transport network, marking 
substantial industrial progress.
SPN 2.0, with innovative TDM and packet 
statistics multiplexing, oﬀers deterministic low 
latency, multi-granularity cross-connection, 
hierarchical slicing, and /f_lexible intelligent 
perception. It is widely applied in typical industrial 
scenarios such as smart grid, smart transportation, 
smart mine, smart port, smart healthcare and 
smart manufacturing, and is emerging as a 
benchmark for the new-generation integrated 
service transport network.

a new SPN-based power communication network 
since 2021 for transporting voice/video LAN, 
integrated data network, and 2M private line 
services. The solution supports large-bandwidth 
networking, hard slicing isolation, intelligent O&M, 
and 10 Mbps FGU, as illustrated in Fig. 2.
Application Prospects
SPN, a new-generation transport network 
technology jointly developed by Chinese 
operators, research institutions, and network 
device vendors, is a leading model in China for 
transport network standard innovation. Slice Name Quantity Slice Type Description
