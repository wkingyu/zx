scenarios (5G+ UHD video, 5G+ remote control, 
5G+ cloud-based AGV, 5G+ machine vision, 5G+ 
drone, 5G+ cloud robot, 5G+ AR, and 5G+ VR) and 
smart grids.
To meet diﬀerentiated service requirements 
across diﬀerent industries, the transport network 
needs to possess the following features:
Hard isolation slicing:  In the industrial sector, 
diverse scenarios including production control, 
collection/detection, and information monitoring, 
require end-to-end hard isolation slicing for 
eﬀective management of mixed and complex 
traﬃc /f_lows.
Carrier-class reliability:  Production services in the 
industrial Internet and smart grids require 
99.999% or higher network reliability. This 
necessitates end-to-end high-reliability network 
protection and recovery mechanisms, and 
carrier-class O&M. 
Deterministic transport: For deterministic needs 
in scenarios like industrial control and monitoring, 
research is crucial for constructing end-to-end 
deterministic networks and innovating 
deterministic transport technology across 
wide-area heterogeneous networks.
Flexible access and scheduling: In the industrial 
sector, service terminals and types vary widely, 
featuring diverse network interfaces, protocols, 
and communication demands. A key aspect of a 
transport network is to ensure extensive access, 
collaborative operation, and /f_lexible, eﬃcient scheduling and forwarding of heterogeneous 
terminals.
Versatile service perception: In-depth service 
perception and the application of new ICT 
technologies strongly support the digital 
transformation and high-quality development of 
industrial users. Achieving deep integration with 
these technologies presents a major challenge for 
communication networks. 
Intelligent control and O&M: Intelligent, 
convenient and open network O&M greatly 
improves the operational eﬃciency and 
autonomy of various industrial Internet services. It 
reduces response time for new service 
deployment, enabling agile innovation in the 
industry.
Standardization and Technical 
Features of SPN 2.0
SPN 2.0 surpasses SPN 1.0 in multiservice transport, 
cloud-network convergence, network coverage, 
intelligent control and O&M, and low-carbon energy 
eﬃciency. With new frame structures and 
cross-connect technologies supporting N×10 Mbps  
/f_ine granularity units (FGU), it expands 10GE small 
access SPN devices for private line access and 
industrial campus application. Moreover, it 
enhances the integrated transport of 5G+ vertical 
industries, enterprise private lines, and 
cloud-network/computing-network convergence
