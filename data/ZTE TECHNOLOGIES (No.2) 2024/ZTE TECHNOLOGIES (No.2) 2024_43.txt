multiple users, or even service interruption. Traditional 
restoration methods, relying on manual analysis and 
location, are time-consuming, ineﬃcient, and 
signi/f_icantly aﬀect customer satisfaction. ZTE’s group 
fault analysis tool integrates a closed-loop process 
encompassing service quality perception, fault 
commonality analysis, fault diagnosis, and fault 
restoration to rapidly locate group faults. Once a key 
service analysis task is initiated, the system monitors 
the quality of the service object in real time. When 
identifying abnormal service quality, the system 
comprehensively analyzes whether the fault is caused 
by a group fault based on current system alarm 
information. If identi/f_ied as a group fault, the system 
starts a fault commonality analysis task to help O&M 
personnel quickly locate and resolve the fault. This 
functionality enables real-time network monitoring 
and group fault analysis within minutes, enhancing 
eﬃciency by over 90% and implementing proactive 
O&M in group fault scenarios.
Maintaining Service Intent: 
Supporting Committable SLA
The most direct factor aﬀecting customer 
experience is the continual maintenance of SLA to 
meet user expectations, which is also a critical 
competitive advantage for operators. The service 
intent maintenance feature introduced by ZTE is 
aimed at ful/f_illing this important task.
ZENIC ONE (UME)’s service intent maintenance 
feature comprises three layers of closed-loop 
capabilities. The /f_irst layer is second-level service 
self-healing, where network-layer devices automatically 
trigger switching or rerouting of corresponding network 
objects upon identifying a service interruption, ensuring 
 
 
rapid resolution. The second layer, minute-level 
service restoration, kicks in when the network layer 
cannot implement second-level self-healing. The 
management and control system identi/f_ies service 
quality issues, locates and analyzes them, generates 
restoration policies, and automatically executes 
restoration commands within minutes. The third 
layer focuses on medium and long-term service 
optimization, predicting and analyzing service 
quality and traﬃc to preemptively address potential 
issues and optimize services. 
At preset, the service intent maintenance function 
at the /f_irst two layers has been successfully 
implemented and veri/f_ied on existing networks. This 
function facilitates self-perception and self-healing 
of service quality, reducing restoration time from 
hours to minutes compared to traditional manual 
O&M. It maintains services “permanently online”, 
simpli/f_ies O&M, and enhances customer experience 
while meeting SLA requirements.
Liaoning Mobile and ZTE have made signi/f_icant 
investments in network O&M to tackle challenges 
and overcome bottlenecks. The intelligent 
closed-loop guarantee system for SPN service 
quality, which integrates intelligent fault diagnosis, 
group fault analysis, and service intent maintenance 
functions, enhances O&M eﬃciency for Liaoning 
Mobile, shifting from passive to active O&M. Looking 
ahead, both parties will extend their cooperation to 
reinforce fault root cause analysis, implement a “one 
fault, one worksheet” approach, and simulate 
restoration solutions, thereby further enhancing 
O&M eﬃciency, expanding application scenarios, 
and leveraging intelligent precise O&M to achieve 
breakthroughs in network O&M.
