ensure ubiquitous access, /f_lexible networking, 
visual and intelligent control, and SLA guarantee. 
SPN 2.0 primarily serves industrial external 
networks in industrial Internet applications. It can 
also be applied to speci/f_ic industrial intranet 
scenarios, like coal, ports, and industrial campuses, 
as required. The small access SPN 2.0 device 
functions as the egress gateway for industrial 
intranets, facilitating eﬀective connections to 
industrial external networks. This includes 
integrated transport with multi-service security 
isolation, end-to-end network slice interworking 
and scheduling, and service capability exposure 
for diﬀerent industry slices.
SPN 2.0 features soft, hard, and hierarchical 
network slicing using N5 Gbps and M10 Mbps MTN 
channels. It provides deterministic transport 
similar to SDH VC-4/VC-12 TDM hard isolation and 
soft isolation with N5 Gbps MTN interfaces. This 
enables high-security isolation, highly reliable 
uni/f_ied transport, and diﬀerentiated SLA 
guarantees for various industrial Internet services 
such as production control, information 
management and Internet access (Fig. 1). It ensures 
comprehensive competitiveness in current 
transport network technology with independent 
and controllable key technologies and a promising 
long-term development prospect.SPN 2.0 Applications in 5G+ Smart Grids and 
Private Power Networks
The 5G-based virtual private network in the power 
industry oﬀers ultra-low latency, massive 
connections, and ultra-high bandwidth. It enables 
end-to-end hard and soft slicing, ensuring various 
levels of security isolation for services across 
diﬀerent power grid areas. This facilitates 
applications like 5G+MEC+slice for remote control, 
diﬀerential protection, DTU, distributed energy, and 
intelligent preventive maintenance, addressing 
communication challenges at the smart grid’s 
endpoints.
5G power distribution network services, 
categorized into control and collection, vary in 
security levels. This includes diﬀerential protection 
with low delay/jitter and high reliability, power 
distribution automation requiring high 
synchronization precision, and large-bandwidth 
video conferencing. SPN power industry wireless 
slices use PRB reservation. Transport SPN is deployed 
through 5 Gbps coarse-grained or 10 Mbps 
/f_ine-grained MTN slices, and UPF takes the form of 
ToB UPF. The main electric power station and ToB UPF 
employ VPN enterprise customer slices and 100 Mbps 
VPN private lines, ensuring assured bandwidth 
delivery (Table 2).
