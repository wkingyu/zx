especially hard slicing isolation, to signi/f_icantly 
reduce network construction costs and simplify 
O&M, laying a solid foundation for intelligent 
mining development. It oﬀers the following 
bene/f_its:
Super-large bandwidth: The all-optical backbone 
ring network can smoothly expand to 100GE 
bandwidth, meeting service development needs 
for the next decade.
One integrated network: Utilizes one /f_iber, one 
set of equipment, and one integrated network for 
industrial, video, and 5G multi-network 
integration.
Security isolation: The FlexE technology supports 
end-to-end hard service isolation, meeting 
diﬀerentiated service quality requirements.
Independence:  China’s new-generation 
international 5G transport standard has 
completed extensive commercial veri/f_ication. 
Practical Implementation
ZTE cooperated with Changzhou Institute of China 
Coal to build an industry-leading 100G SPN Ethernet 
slice ring network for Shaanxi Coal and Chemical 
Industry Group’s Xizhuo coal mine in November 2022. 
This network provides integrated service 
transmission for both aboveground and 
underground production in smart mines. ZTE SPN 
devices use the MTN hard slicing isolation 
technology to provide a physical ring network for 
mining operations, with multiple logical rings 
catering to various intelligent mine subsystem 
services.
The successful application of SPN technology in 
the B2B /f_ield will lay a reliable foundation for the 
development of intelligent mines at the Xizhuo coal 
mine, accelerating the digital transformation towards 
5G+ intelligent mining.
