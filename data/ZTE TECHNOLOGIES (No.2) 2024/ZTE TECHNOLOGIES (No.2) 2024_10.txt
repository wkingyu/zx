Starting in mid-2019, China Mobile explored SPN 
/f_ine-granularity technology for 5G+ industries and 
enterprise private lines. It adopted the N×10 Mbps-based 
FGU solution, releasing the  Technical White Paper on 
SPN FGU in June 2021. By the second half of 2021, 
enterprise standards were completed. In June 2022, 
SPN 2.0 technical white paper and private line 
products were launched, and comprehensive 
evaluation of multi-vendor SPN 2.0 equipment is 
ongoing. China’s Ministry of Industry and 
Information Technology (MIIT) has oﬃcially 
published three SPN industry standards: YD/T 
3826-2021, YD/T 3974-2021, and YD/T 4172-2022. 
Additionally, three industry standards, including Test 
Methods for SPN Equipment,  have been submitted for 
approval. Research is ongoing for six industry 
standards, such as  Technical Requirements for 
Fine-Granularity Transport of SPN and Technical 
Requirements for Interworking of SPN.
As a key technology in the SPN slicing channel 
layer, metro transport network (MTN) has 
systematic international standards in ITU-T. By 
January 2023, /f_ive international standard 
recommendations (MTN architecture G.8310, MTN 
interface G.8312, MTN equipment function G.8321, 
MTN linear protection G.8331, MTN network 
management and control G.8350) and one technical report of network evolution G.sup.69 
had been released. The MTN synchronization 
standard was completed in 2023. At the 
September 2022 ITU-T SG15 plenary session, 
Chinese members successfully obtained approval 
for the G.fgMTN standard, indicating international 
recognition for the core architecture and key 
technologies of the MTN extension /f_ine-granularity 
sub-channel.
Research on SPN 2.0 Application 
Solutions in Industrial Scenarios
Analysis of SPN 2.0 Applications in Industry 
Scenarios
The industrial Internet includes two network 
application scenarios: industrial intranet and 
industrial external network. The industrial intranet 
connects the data of production, control and other 
enterprise sectors, managing daily operations 
through OT and IT networks. The industrial 
external network provides highly reliable, 
low-latency connections for remote production 
control. Telecom operators in China must evolve 
into integrated service providers supporting the 
industrial Internet. Their networks should not only 
prioritize reliable security, carrier-class high 
reliability and deterministic transport, but also
