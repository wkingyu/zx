air holes , respectively . Measured results have confirmed that 
the simple decoupling structures are quite effective to reduce 
the mutual coupling level below −25 dB.
Fig. 15 shows the photo of the four -element differential 
quasi -Yagi array without any decoupling structure . The two ad ‐
jacent differential quasi -Yagi antenna elements are separated 
by 0.5 free space wavelength at 10 GHz .
Fig. 16 shows the measured | Sdd11| and | Sdd21| as a function 
of frequency for the top two differential quasi -Yagi elements . 
The measured impedance bandwidth is from 7.6 GHz to 
14.3 GHz . The mutual coupling level is below −20 dB over 
the impedance bandwidth .
Fig. 17 shows the simulated and calculated radiation pat ‐
terns for the four -element differential quasi -Yagi array at 
10 GHz . Due to limitations of our testing facilities , we could 
not measure the array patterns . We measured the element pat ‐
tern and obtained the calculated patterns by considering the 
array factor . It is seen that the calculated and simulated pat ‐
terns agree quite well for the main lobes . There are differences 
between the calculated and simulated side lobes .
4 Conclusions
In this paper , a novel differential quasi -Yagi antenna is pre ‐
sented and compared with a normal single -ended counterpart 
for the first time . It is found that the differential quasi -Yagi an ‐
tenna outperforms the conventional single -ended one . The dif ‐
ferential quasi -Yagi antenna is then used as an element for E -
plane linear arrays . A study of the coupling mechanism be ‐
tween the two differential quasi -Yagi antennas is conducted . 
The driver is identified to be the decisive part for the mutual 
coupling . Four decoupling structures and their effects are 
evaluated . The arrays with simple but effective decoupling 
structures are fabricated and measured . The measured results 
demonstrate that the coupling levels of these arrays can be re ‐
duced to less than –25 dB over the broad bandwidth and the 
simple slit or air -hole decoupling structure has a negligible ef ‐
fect on the impedance matching and radiation patterns of the 
arrays . It is anticipated that the differential quasi -Yagi an ‐
tenna , as a promising antenna candidate , should find wide ap ‐
plications in wireless communication systems , power combin ‐
ing, phased , active , imaging , and MIMO arrays .
