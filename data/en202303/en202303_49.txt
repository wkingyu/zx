where UH
M is the M-dimensional discrete Fourier transform 
(DFT) matrix . The angular domain channel is sparse with few 
elements of dominant magnitude . This is attributed to the high 
spatial resolution of massive MIMO , leveraging large -scale an ‐
tennas against finite propagation paths . Also , due to the spec ‐
tral leakage of DFT , the angular domain channel reveals a 
clustered sparsity structure with nonzero elements spaced ad ‐
jacent to dominant elements[17].
In the URA scenario , active users pick up codewords/col ‐
umns from a common codebook/coding matrix to transmit the 
B-bit payload . We choose to generate the common codebook 
by the sparse regression code[18]. Each entry of the codebook 
A=[a1,⋯, a2B]∈CN×2B is generated from an i .i.d. Gaussian 
distribution CN(1, 1/N) such that E{a2
2}=1. We assume 
that oscillators at users are synchronized to the same fre ‐
quency through calibration[19–20], i.e., CFOs are the same for 
all users . Considering a block fading channel where channel 
coefficients remain unchanged in N symbol transmissions , the 
received signal at the BS under CFO is represented as
Y͂=∑kdiag(τ(ω))aikh͂T
k+W͂=diag(τ(ω))ABH͂+W͂ ,(4)
where ω≜2πΔfT with Δf the frequency offset between users 
and the BS in Hz and T the sampling period , τ(ω)=
[1, ejω,⋯, ej(N-1)ω]T is the corresponding phase rotation vector 
due to CFO , B∈{0,1}2B×Ka is a selection matrix , H͂=
[h͂
1,⋯, h͂
Ka]T∈CKa×M, and W͂ is the AWGN matrix with ele ‐
ments generated from i .i.d. CN(0, σ2
w). The (ik, k)-th entry of 
B is nonzero only if the k-th user transmits the information se ‐
quence mk with decimal(mk)=ik, where decimal(mk) is the 
the radix ten equivalent of mk. The received signal in the angu ‐
lar domain can be calculated as
Y=diag(τ(ω))ABH͂U*
M+W͂U*
M=diag(τ(ω))ABH+W,
(5)
where H=[h1,⋯, hKa]T, and W≜W͂U*
M is the equivalent 
noise matrix .
3 Proposed Algorithm for JADCE under CFO
3.1 Problem Formulation and Probability Model
Data detection in URA is to determine which column of A is 
transmitted . For better illustration , we rewrite Eq . (5) as
Y=diag(U*
N|c)AX+W=Z+W, (6)
where UN is the N-dimensional DFT matrix , c=UT
Nτ(ω) is sparse due to the Vandermonde structure of τ(ω), X≜BH, 
and Z≜diag(U*
Nc)AX. Since Ka≪2B, X is row sparse . Fur‐
thermore , the sparse rate of X is promoted due to the sparsity 
of angular domain channels . Our purpose is to recover sparse 
c and X from the noisy observation Y with known UN and A, 
recognized as a CS recovery problem . Note that the URA re ‐
ceiver does not attempt to link the message to its source de ‐
vice, therefore , we do no need to reconstruct B.
To solve the structured -matrix estimation problem , we start 
with reformulating the random variable dependency corre ‐
sponding to Eq . (6), taking on the form
zn,m=∑i=1N∑j=12Bciz(i, j)
n,mxj,m , (7)
where z()i, j
n,m≜un,ian,j is an element of a third -order tensor 
{z()i,j
n=[z()i, j
n,1,⋯,z()i, j
n,M]T}∀i,j. For the sparse vector c, we assign 
a Bernoulli -Gaussian prior to each independent component 
ci, i.e.,
p(ci)=λcδ(cn)+(1-λc)CN(0, σ2
c) , (8)
where λc is the sparsity fraction of c and δ(∙) represents the 
Dirac -delta function . Similarly , a Bernoulli -Gaussian prior is 
used to model the conditional probability
p(xj, m|sj, m)=δ(xj, m)δ(sj, m+1)+
CN(xj, m;0, σ2
x)δ(sj, m-1) , (9)
where sj, m∈{-1, 1} is the binary state of xj, m with sj, m=±1 
signifying that xj, m is nonzero/zero . To capture the clustered 
sparsity of the angular domain channel support sj, :=
[sj, 1,⋯, sj, M], we employ the Markov chain (MC) model[21] as 
follows
p(sj, :)=p(sj,1)∏m=2Mp(sj, m|||sj, m-1),(10)
where the transition probability p(sj, m|sj, m-1) is given by
p(sj, m|sj, m-1)=ì
í
îïïïï
ïïïï() 1-p011-sj,mpsj,m
01, sj, m-1=0
() 1-p10sj,mp1-sj,m
01, sj, m-1=1 , (11)
and p(sj,1) is initialized as a steady -state distribution with 
p(sj,1=0)=p10(p01+p10) and p(sj,1=1)=p10(p01+p10). 
The MC model depicts the average cluster size and the aver ‐
age gap between two clusters by parameters p10 and p01, re‐
spectively . A smaller value of p10 indicates a larger cluster 
length and a smaller value of p01 leads to a larger average gap 
between two clusters . And in general , the sparsity of x is mea ‐
sured as λx≜p10(p01+p10).
