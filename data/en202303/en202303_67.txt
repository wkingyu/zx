pairs , and a matching network . In this paper , we design a 
220 GHz sub -harmonic mixer using Schottky diodes , and the 
circuit substrate is based on a 50 μm quartz substrate .
The mixer and the internal circuit are shown in Fig . 3. The 
cavity is made of brass , which is gold -plated on the surface . 
During the test , the output power of the LO link is controlled 
within 3–8 mW , and the input RF signal power is uniformly 
adjusted to −10 dBm .
The measured result shows that when the LO and RF signal 
input 204 GHz and 195–220 GHz , respectively , the fre ‐
quency conversion loss is less than 10 dB, which is 8.8 dB at 
minimum , as shown in Fig . 4(a). After changing the LO fre ‐quency to 216 GHz , the frequency conversion loss is less than 
10.3 dB, which is 8.9 dB at minimum , as shown in Fig . 4(b).
3.2 220 GHz Duplexer Study
In this paper , the designed duplexer adopts the reactance -
coupled bandpass filter structure , as shown in Fig . 5. The 
mode of each resonant cavity is TE101 and the resonant cavity 
length is approximated as a half wavelength . The parameters 
affecting the filter performance are mainly the length of each 
resonant cavity li and the width of each coupling window wi. 
Changing li has a significant effect on the center frequency , 
and the length of the resonant cavity near the center l2 has a 
higher effect on the center frequency than l1. Adjusting wi has 
a certain effect on the in -band characteristics and bandwidth .
Two different band filters with center frequencies of 203 GHz 
and 214 GHz are designed . It can be seen from Fig . 6 that the 
simulation results show the bandwidths are 6 GHz and the in -
band insertion loss (IL) is lower than 0.1 dB.
