we set Tmax= 100, Tmc= 20, and the precision tolerance τ=
10-4. Since we focus on whether active codewords are properly 
determined , the misdetection rate is used as the AD perfor ‐
mance metric , i.e.,
Pm=||A∖X
||A  , (29)
where A is the set of indexes of active codewords . The algo ‐
rithm in the aspect of CE is assessed by the normalized mean 
square error (NMSE ) of the recovered active channels , i.e., 
NMSE= Xˉ-Xa2
FXˉ2
F, where Xˉ is the original channel 
matrix arranged according to the indexes in Eq . (28), and Xa is 
the estimated active channel matrix . The NMSE performance 
of MC -PBiGAMP in each iteration is exhibited in Fig . 2. We 
observe that the proposed algorithm converges around 65–74 
iteration rounds under different signal -to-noise ratios (SNRs ).
For comparison , we appeal to the method in Ref . [16]. To 
deal with the influence of CFO , the discrete CFO parameters 
[ω1,⋯ ωR] with R=9 are uniformly sampled from the pos ‐
sible range . JADCE is then performed using the MMV -GAMP 
algorithm[14] with the measurement matrix constructed by ex ‐
panding the original one with these sampled frequency offsets . 
We also investigate the PBiGAMP algorithm[22] with no sup ‐
port structure for JADCE . The JADCE performance of the 
aforementioned methods versus the SNR 
or the number of measurements Ns is de ‐
picted in Fig . 3. The proposed MC -
PBiGAMP algorithm outperforms the 
original PBiGAMP algorithm as we take 
into account the correlation between ad ‐
jacent angular domain channel elements 
by the MC support model . Although MC -
PBiGAMP with respect to the AD perfor ‐
mance is about the same as MMV -
GAMP in Ref . [16], the advantage lies in 
that it only needs to handle a CFO esti ‐
mation problem of scale 2J×Ns×M 
compared with the latter of scale D×
2J×Ns×M. It is indicated in Fig . 3(c) 
that the misdetection rates of both algo ‐
rithms decrease significantly when Ns>
Ka. This coincides with the scaling law 
of AMP that requires measurements to 
reliably identify a subset of Ka active 
codewords among a set of size 2J scales 
as Ns=O(Kalog2J
Ka), i.e., Ns is almost 
linearly with Ka.
The error rate of URA transmission is 
defined as the average per user probabil ‐
