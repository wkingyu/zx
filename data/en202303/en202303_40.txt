usually printed on the bottom surface of the substrate , which 
has another function as the ground plane .
The design procedure of the differential quasi -Yagi antenna 
is as follows . It starts with choosing a substrate for the maxi ‐
mum excitation of the surface wave of the TE0 mode by an 
electric dipole on the substrate at the central frequency of the 
operating band . ALEXOPOULOS et al . examined how the sub ‐
strate affects the excitation of surface waves[10]. They found 
that the surface wave of the TE0 mode can be maximumly ex ‐
cited if the critical value of the substrate electrical thickness 
is satisfied . Using the method described in the classical pa ‐
per[10], LEONG and ITOH showed that the critical values for 
the electrical thickness are 0.03, 0.05, and 0.08 for the sub ‐
strates with εr =10.2, 4, and 2.2, respectively[8]. Then , the ini ‐
tial values are set for the length l0 and width w0 of the director , 
the distance d1 between the director and the driver , the length 
l1 and width w1 of the driver , and the distance d2 from the 
driver to the reflector . For simplicity , the same width of 0.02λ0 
can be chosen for the driver and director . The length of the 
driver is about 0.45λg. The length of the director should be 
shorter than that of the driver and can be 0.3λg. The distances 
between the director and driver and between the driver and re ‐
flector are about 0.3λg and 0.25λg, respectively . Next , the 
width w2 and spacing g0 of the CPS line can be estimated with 
the available empirical formula . Finally , the optimum values 
for the above design parameters can be obtained from High 
Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS ) simulations .
Fig. 2 shows the photo of the differential quasi -Yagi an ‐
tenna designed and fabricated on a substrate of dielectric con ‐
stant εr = 10.2 and thickness h=0.635 mm at X -band frequen ‐
cies. The fabricated dimensions are ws =15 mm, wg=4.4 mm, w0=w1=0.6 mm, w2=1.5 mm, ls=17 mm, l0=3.2 mm, l1=8.7 mm, 
l2 =1.3 mm, l3 =3.9 mm, d0 = 3.3 mm, d1=3.2 mm, d2=6.1 mm, 
g0=0.3 mm, and g1=0.6 mm.
Fig. 3 shows the simulated electric field distributions on the 
top and bottom surfaces of the differential quasi -Yagi antenna . 
As expected , the surface wave of the TE0 mode is indeed 
strongly excited and propagated in the directions normal to the 
driver . On the one hand , since the polarization direction of the 
electric field on the driver is the same as that of the electric 
field on the director , there will be a strong coupling between
