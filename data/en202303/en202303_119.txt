Abstract : The railway mobile communication system is undergoing a smooth transition from the Global System for Mobile Communications -
Railway (GSM -R) to the Railway 5G. In this paper , an empirical path loss model based on a large amount of measured data is established to 
predict the path loss in the Railway 5G marshalling yard scenario . According to the different characteristics of base station directional anten ‐
nas, the antenna gain is verified . Then we propose the position of the breakpoint in the antenna propagation area , and based on the breakpoint 
segmentation , a large -scale statistical model for marshalling yards is established .
Keywords : 5G-R; marshalling yard ; path loss prediction ; statistical modeling

1 Introduction
With the deployment and advancement of the 5G 
“new infrastructure ” strategy , a series of techno ‐
logical innovations for the new generation of rail ‐
way mobile communication are actively being car ‐
ried out in China . Taking 5G as an opportunity , 5G for Rail ‐
way (5G-R) has been widely regarded as a solution to meeting 
the diverse requirements of railway wireless communica ‐
tions[1–2]. Railway 5G is composed of 5G-R and the public 5G 
network dedicated to the railway . Among them , 5G-R refers to 
a private 5G network that provides services for the railway sys ‐
tem, which is completely independent and highly reliable . 
However , the current 5G-R bandwidth is limited and cannot 
carry a large number of high -bandwidth services in railways[3]. 
It is necessary to use the dedicated frequency of the public 5G 
network to carry out some services uncorrelated to driving 
safety because the 5G-R frequency has not been approved . At 
present , the development of the Railway 5G is in the prelimi ‐
nary stage , without enough technical standards for the con ‐
struction of a railway wireless network . For various scenarios 
with higher frequencies , it is necessary to conduct a large num ‐
ber of field measurements and tests to collect test data . The current technical standards can be summarized and improved 
more accurately based on these data . Compared with the previ ‐
ous, the current railway system has changed a lot . Therefore , 
we need to determine the field strength prediction model un ‐
der typical railway scenarios and provide corresponding tech ‐
nical standards for the construction of the Railway 5G through 
the evaluation of wireless network coverage . At the same time , 
high -speed railway is also one of the important application sce ‐
narios of the 6G mobile communication technology in the fu ‐
ture. A 6G network can provide more comprehensive perfor ‐
mance indicators , such as ultra -low delay jitter , ultra -high se ‐
curity , stereo coverage , and ultra -high positioning accuracy . 
With the help of 6G, more high -speed railway business and ap ‐
plication requirements can be realized , and the development 
of railway digitalization can be promoted[4]. Therefore , we not 
only need to build a 5G-R network in an all -round way , but 
also make theoretical and technical preparations for 6G.
The channel parameters of 5G including path loss exponent 
and shadow fading were measured in the scene of campus in 
Ref. [5]. A new path loss prediction model for the viaduct area 
was deduced through statistical analysis of the measurement 
results in Ref . [6]. To model the path loss of viaducts and 
plains , Ref . [7] proposed a modified free space model with 
good results . The authors in Ref . [8] divided viaducts into four 
areas : suburban , open , mountainous and urban . They calcu ‐
lated respective path loss exponent and standard deviations of 
shadow fading . Ref. [9] measured and analyzed the path loss
