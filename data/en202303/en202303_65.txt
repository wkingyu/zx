Abstract : With the development of wireless communication , the 6G mobile communication technology has received wide attention . As one of 
the key technologies of 6G, terahertz （THz） communication technology has the characteristics of ultra -high bandwidth , high security and low 
environmental noise . In this paper , a THz duplexer with a half -wavelength coupling structure and a sub -harmonic mixer operating at 216 GHz 
and 204 GHz are designed and measured . Based on these key devices , a 220 GHz frequency -division multiplexing communication system is 
proposed , with a real -time data rate of 10.4 Gbit/s for one channel and a transmission distance of 15 m. The measured constellation diagram of 
two receivers is clearly visible , the signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) is higher than 22 dB, and the bit error ratio (BER ) is less than 10−8. Further ‐
more , the high definition (HD) 4K video can also be transmitted in real time without stutter .
Keywords : frequency -division multiplexing ; sub -harmonic mixer ; terahertz communication ; terahertz duplexer

1 Introduction
With the development of wireless communication 
technology , the global mobile data traffic is grow ‐
ing exponentially , and the demand for high -speed 
and low -latency data transmission is gradually 
growing[1]. However , the currently used millimeter wave band 
cannot achieve these visions , so researchers turn their atten ‐
tion to the terahertz (THz) band . THz waves range from 0.1 to 
100 THz , and the THz wireless communication has strong di ‐
rectionality , excellent security , and wide bandwidth , which 
has a communication rate of more than 100 Gbit/s .
The NTT Laboratories in Japan first started research on THz 
wireless communication in 2004 , the carrier frequency of which 
is 120 GHz under amplitude shift keying (ASK) modulation for 
a data rate of 10 Gbit/s[2]. In recent years , this team has devel ‐
oped 300 GHz power amplifiers , low -noise amplifiers , and base -
wave mixers based on 80 nm InP -HEMT technology in Ref . [3], 
and the proposed THz wireless link has achieved a wireless data rate of up to 120 Gbit/s based on 16 quadrature amplitude 
modulation (QAM ) modulation over a transmission distance of 
9.8 m. In Ref . [4], the communication system is developed by 
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology with a carrier frequency of 
237.5 GHz under 16QAM modulation . The proposed system 
achieved 100 Gbit/s over a distance of 20 m. With the sup ‐
port of the DOTSEVEN project , the team of the Institute for 
High Frequency and Communication Technology has devel ‐
oped a 240 GHz full integrated transceiver chip based on a 
130 nm SiGe Bi -COMS technology to achieve 10 Gbit/s over 
a transmission distance of 15 cm and a BER of less than 
10−9[5]. Recently , this team has also achieved Quadrature Phase 
Shift Keying (QPSK ) modulated signal transmission at a trans ‐
mission distance of 1 m and a transmission rate of 110 Gbit/s 
with a measured error vector magnitude (EVM ) of 31.9% based 
on the 130 nm SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT ) 
technology in the 220–225 GHz band[6]. The 220 GHz commu ‐
nication system[7] built by University of Electronic Science and 
Technology of China is based on the THz solid -state receiving 
front -end, which can realize 3.52 Gbit/s wireless communica ‐
tion over a distance of 200 m using QPSK modulation . In Ref . 
[8], the Chinese Academy of Engi neering Physics developed a 
140 GHz wireless link for offshore communication , which has
