certain applicable values in the marshalling yard scenario .
6 Challenges
In the statistical model , the path loss will increase with the 
growing of the distance between transceiver antennas as a 
whole . There is no need to consider detailed environmental in ‐
formation when the large -scale fading empirical model is ap ‐
plied to the scenario . In specific environments , such as rail ‐
way marshalling yards , the transmission of radio waves may 
encounter fading and other conditions , resulting in changes in 
the final received power to reach the user , making it difficult 
to determine the specific value of the calculated path loss . 
This is also a deficiency of large -scale fading empirical mod ‐
els. In the future , it is hoped to re -validate predictions with 
the help of deterministic modeling , machine learning and 
other methods to achieve higher prediction accuracy .
7 Conclusions
In this paper , the calculation method of the propagation de ‐
marcation point for marshalling yard scenarios is proposed 
and verified to improve the accuracy of the subsequent empiri ‐
cal model . Based on numerous measured data , a large -scale 
path loss statistical empirical model for marshalling yard sce ‐
narios is established , and the propagation boundary point is re ‐
garded as the model segmentation point . The path loss in Area 
A conforms to the two -path model , and that in Area B is close 
to the logarithmic model . According to the measurement data 
in different cells , the correction factor in the marshalling yard 
scenario is fitted with the Hata model as the benchmark . Fi‐
nally , the shortcomings and improvements that need to be 
made to the statistical model are discussed .
