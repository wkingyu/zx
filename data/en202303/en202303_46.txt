Biographies
ZHU Zhihao received his BS degree from Hangzhou Dianzi University , China 
in 2016 . He is currently pursuing an MS degree in electronic science and tech ‐
nology with Shanghai Jiao Tong University , China . His research interests in ‐
clude antenna theory and design , especially in shorted patch antennas , broad ‐
band printed antennas , antenna decoupling , and antenna -in-package (AiP).
ZHANG Yueping (eypzhang@ntu .edu.sg) is a full professor with the School of 
Electrical and Electronic Engineering , Nanyang Technological University , Sin‐
gapore . He is a Distinguished Lecturer of the IEEE Antennas and Propagation 
Society (IEEE AP -S) and Fellow of the IEEE . He was a member of the IEEE 
AP-S Field Award Committee (2015–2017 ) and an associate editor of IEEE 
Transactions on Antennas and Propagation  (2010–2016 ). Prof . ZHANG has 
published numerous papers , including two invited papers and one regular paper 
in the Proceedings of the IEEE  and one invited paper in IEEE Transactions on 
Antennas and Propagation . He is a Chinese radio scientist who has published a 
historical article in English learned journals such as the IEEE Antennas and 
Propagation Magazine . He received the 2012  IEEE AP -S Sergei A . Schelkunoff 
Prize Paper Award . Prof . ZHANG has been invited to deliver plenary speeches 
at the flagship conferences organized by IEEE , CIE , EurAAP , and IEICE . He 
received the Best Paper Award from the 2nd IEEE/IET International Sympo ‐
sium on Communication Systems , Networks and Digital Signal Processing , the 
Best Paper Prize from the 3rd IEEE International Workshop on Antenna Tech ‐
nology , and the Best Paper Award from the 10th IEEE Global Symposium on 
Millimeter -Waves . He holds seven US patents . He has made pioneering and sig ‐
nificant contributions to the development of AiP technology . He received the 
2020  IEEE AP -S John Kraus Antenna Award . His current interests are in the 
development of antenna -on-chip (AoC) technology for very large -scale antenna 
integration and characterization of chip -scale propagation channels at terahertz 
for wireless chip area networks (WCAN ).
