lated channel model to describe the potential correlations of 
each channel prediction error in the past slots and express the 
error model for the k-th piece of UE in the DL time slots of the 
i-th half -frame period ,
H͂
i,k=Er(Ω⊙Hi.i.d.)EtH . (3)
The statistical information Er, Et and Ω are gathered from 
practical error samples for the UE , where Er and Et are deter ‐
ministic unitary matrices that reveal the correlation of the 
transmit and receive antennas respectively , while each ele ‐
ment of Ω is the square root of the element of the eigenmode 
channel coupling matrix . Hi.i.d. is a random matrix with zero 
mean and unit variance entries , following i .i.d. For illustration 
purposes , we depict the error model with the time slot struc ‐
ture in Fig . 3.
For simplicity , we use Hk as a substitute for HDt
i,k in the fol ‐
lowing part to denote the CSI matrix for the k-th UE consider ‐
ing the beamforming design for only one typical DL transmis ‐
sion time slot . Based on the analysis mentioned above , the 
channel matrix for UE can be divided into two parts : the de ‐
termined prediction channel matrix Ĥ
k and the random error 
matrix H͂
k.
2.3 Problem Formulation
Denote the linear precoding matrix for the k-th piece of UE 
as Vk∈CNt×1. The receive signal of the k-th piece of UE yk at 
this DL time slot is
yk=HkVksk+∑
m=1, m≠kK
HkVmsm+nk , (4)
where the transmit signal to the k-th piece of UE sk is indepen ‐
dent random variables with zero mean and unit variance ; nk 
represents the additive white Gaussian noise with the distribu ‐
tion CN(0, σ2INr). Then , the achievable data rate for UE at a 
DL time slot can be expressed as
Rk=Eì

To simplify the objective , we treat the aggregate 
interference -plus -noise as the Gaussian noise for UE and de ‐
note its covariance matrix as
Qk=σ2I+Eì

Then the achievable rate for UE at a DL time slot can be re ‐written as
Rk=E{logdet(I+HkVkVH

Furthermore , the achievable weighted sum rate of the sys ‐
tem can be expressed as
R=τ

k=1K

Aiming at optimizing the beamforming matrix to maximize 
the expected weighted sum rate at a typical DL slot , we can ex ‐
press the optimization problem as

where {αk} is the weighting coefficient to ensure fairness 
among the UE and P denotes the power budget of the BS . 
Based on the channel model where prediction errors are 
taken into consideration , we investigate the optimal robust 
beamforming design for the proposed problem in the next 
section .
3 Proposed Robust Beamforming Design
Due to the randomness introduced by the channel predic ‐
tion error , it is difficult to obtain the close -form expressions of 
the objective . To deal with the randomness , a robust beam ‐
forming design is proposed by considering deterministic 
equivalents . The NP -hard Problem (9) can be resolved by ex ‐
ploiting the relationship between the rate and the mean -
square error (MSE ) matrix , inspired by Ref . [5]. Denote the es ‐
timated signal at the receiver as ŝk=UH
kyk, where Uk denotes 
the receive beamformer of the k-th piece of UE . Assuming that 
signal sk and noise nk are independent , the MSE matrix can be 
written as
MSEk=Es,n{(ŝk-sk)(ŝk-sk)H}=
(I-UH
kHkVk)(I-UH
kHkVk)H+∑
m≠kK

Fixing all of the transmitting beamforming matrices and 
adopting the well -known MMSE receiver , we can rewrite the 
MSE matrix as
Ek=MSEk(Ummse
k)=
I-VkHHkH(Qk+HkVkVkHHkH)-1HkVk . (11)
Note that Rk=E{logdet(E-1
k) } can be expressed as a con ‐
vex function of Ek. Using the first -order condition of the con ‐
vex function , we can obtain
