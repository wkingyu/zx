Abstract : This paper proposes a raptor -like low -density parity -check (RL-LDPC ) code design together with the corresponding decoder hard ‐
ware architecture aiming at next -generation mobile communication . A new kind of protograph different from the 5G new radio (NR) LDPC ba ‐
sic matrix is presented , and a code construction algorithm is proposed to improve the error -correcting performance . A multi -core layered de ‐
coder architecture that supports up to 100 Gbit/s throughput is designed based on the special protograph structure .

1 Introduction
5G is emerging as a promising technology on a global 
scale . However , with the demand for virtual reality (VR), 
Metaverse , and other high throughput applications , the 
transmission speed needs to be improved . As one of the 
most important technologies in wireless communication , chan ‐
nel coding is of great significance to the improvement of sys ‐
tem reliability[1].
Low -density parity -check (LDPC ) codes have been applied 
in many communication systems due to their top performance , 
which is close to the Shannon limit and suitable for parallel 
structures . LDPC codes were first proposed by GALLAGER in 
1963[2], and in 1996 , MACKAY and NEAL proposed the posi ‐
tional degree propagation iterative decoding algorithm for 
LDPC codes[3], which significantly improved performance .
Code construction is a critical part of LDPC code design 
because it directly affects error correction performance . The 
random construction method cannot guarantee the absence 
of short cycles . Based on this , the progressive edge growth 
(PEG ) algorithm was proposed[4], which tries to avoid short 
cycles . Some improved PEG algorithms were proposed in Refs. [5–6], which failed to guarantee the good perfor ‐
mance of the code . The approximate cycle extrinsic (ACE ) 
message degree algorithm was suggested in Ref . [7], which 
could eliminate the cycles selectively in the LDPC codes . 
The codes constructed by the ACE algorithm have lower er ‐
ror floors but perform worse in the waterfall region than the 
PEG algorithm .
Typically , the LDPC code can be obtained by lifting the pro ‐
tograph , which is a structure that governs the macroscopic sta ‐
tistics of the code . The protograph is an important optimiza ‐
tion object in LDPC design because it determines the error -
correcting performance of LDPC codes . Some wireless commu ‐
nication LDPC codes are designed with this approach , like the 
5G NR LDPC code .
The belief propagation (BP) algorithm is the classic decod ‐
ing algorithm for LDPC codes . The BP algorithm is computa ‐
tionally intensive and not conducive to hardware implementa ‐
tion, so researchers have proposed the min -sum decoding algo ‐
rithm , which still uses the idea of iterative decoding with 
probabilistic computation but reduces the hardware resource 
greatly . It occupies an important position in the implementa ‐
tion of LDPC decoders , and most of the decoders adopt this 
method as a guiding idea .
The code construction algorithm and the decoding algo ‐
rithm tend to affect the performance of the code , while the
