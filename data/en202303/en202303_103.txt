each subcarrier and the FDBF with zero -forcing (ZF), are ad ‐
opted , and their performance curves are labeled as “FD-SVD” 
and “FD-ZF”, respectively .
It can be seen from this figure that the proposed HBF -WMO 
algorithm with the FC architecture performs well with far fewer 
RF chains than antenna elements , and its performance gain 
over the PC architecture is about 4 dB in CDL -A. The reason is 
that there are much fewer entries that can be optimized in the 
HBF matrix of the PC architecture than the FC architecture , 
since the PC architecture employs far fewer phase shifters . Re‐
sults also show that the OL architecture achieves the compro ‐
mise between the system performance and hardware costs , 
when compared with the FC and PC architectures . In particu ‐
lar, it achieves higher spectral efficiency than the PC architec ‐
ture at the cost of higher power consumption and implementa ‐
tion complexity introduced by more phase shifters . For ex ‐
ample , with 192 more phased shifters employed , the first type 
of OL architecture has a performance gain of about 1 dB over 
the PC architecture . According to Ref . [24], based on the state -
of-the-art technique , the power consumed by each phase shifter 
is about 10 mW . With the size of overlapped antennas among 
different subarrays growing , the performance improvement of 
the OL architecture over the PC architecture gets bigger . For ex ‐
ample , with the third type of OL architecture , the performance 
gain is about 3 dB over the PC one .
To verify the generality of the proposed HBF -WMO algo ‐
rithm , we provide in Figs . 5 and 6 the spectral efficiency per ‐
formance with different numbers of transmit antennas and RF 
chains under fixed hybrid architectures . The label “OL 1/2”
