connected neural network including two dense hidden layers . 
Suppose the number of neurons of the two layers is NL1 andNL2. 
The dimension of the input feature vector is 4s+1 and the di ‐
mension of the output feature vector is 2s. Therefore , the com ‐
puting complexity is O(s2×NL1×NL2). We need to store the 
weights and bias of the middle layer and the values of thresh ‐
olds, which results in a space complexity of O(NL1+NL2+s). 
By using additional space and computing resources , our AC -
DCRS can intelligently adjust the threshold and achieve a bet ‐
ter performance .
4 Performance Evaluation
4.1 Simulation Setting
We use a typical satellite system mobility model and basic 
assumptions , the parameters for the satellite communication 
network and the AC algorithm are shown in Tables 1 and 2 re‐
spectively .
4.2 Numerical Results
First, we examine the relationship between overall access 
failure probability O(t), which is approximately equal to the 
negative long -term accumulated reward , with the varying total 
call arrival rate λ. As shown in Fig . 4, since our optimization 
objective is to minimize O(t), the greater O(t), the worse over ‐
all system performance . We can see that the proposed AC -DCRS algorithm can learn better admission control strategies 
and achieve better overall system performance , compared with 
FCR, HPFCR , and DCR in most traffic scenarios . However , 
there is no obvious advantage in the scenarios of very low and 
high traffic loads . This is because AC -DCRS needs some trial -
and -error interactions with the environment . Reducing the 
thresholds of low -priority services causes some call failures in 
low -traffic scenarios , and multiple next -highest priority ser ‐
vices get admission to quickly filling up the channel , which af ‐
fects the overall access failure probability in high -traffic load 
scenarios .
Next, we explore the relationship between the channel utili ‐
zation and the average call success rate with the varying total 
call arrival rate λ. From Figs . 5 and 6, we can find that the 
channel utilization increases with the traffic load , and the av ‐
erage call success rate decreases with the traffic load . We can ▼Table 1. Simulation parameters
