As for messages passed within the MC model , the input , i.e., 
the message from variable node xj,m to factor node p(xj,m|sj,m) is 
a complex Gaussian distribution with mean r̂j,m and variance 
μr
j,m. Then , we have the message from factor node p(xj,m|sj,m) to 
variable node sj,m computed as
υj,m=ρj,mδ(sj, m-1)+(1-ρj,m)δ(sj, m+1) , (18)
where

The forward message passing over MC sj, : is conducted in a 
recursive way as follows[21]
φj,1=λx=p01
p01+p10 , (20)
φj,m=p01() 1-ρj,m-1() 1-φj,m-1+p11ρj,m-1φj,m-1
() 1-ρj,m-1() 1-φj,m-1+ρj,m-1φj,m-1.(21)
The backward message passing is performed in a simi ‐
lar way[21]:
φj,M=1

φj,m=
p10() 1-ρj,m+1() 1-φj,m+1+() 1-p10ρj,m+1φj,m+1
() p00+p10() 1-ρj,m+1() 1-φj,m+1+() p11+p01ρj,m+1φj,m+1.(23)
Subsequently , the message from variable node sj,m to factor 
node p(xj,m|sj,m) is represented as
υj,m=ρj,mδ(sj,m-1)+(1-ρj,m)δ(sj,m+1),(24)
where
ρj,m=φj,mφj,m
() 1-φj,m() 1-φj,m+φj,mφj,m. (25)
After that , the output of the MC support estimation module , 
i.e., the message from factor node p(xj,m|sj,m) to variable node 
xj,m is expressed as a Bernoulli -Gaussian distribution 
ρj,mCN(xj,m;0, σ2
x)+(1-ρj,m)δ(xj,m). Finally , we calculate 
the posterior mean and variance of p(xj,m|Y) as[13]x̂j,m=E{xj,m|Y;r̂j,m, μr

The above message components are updated iteratively un ‐
til a certain stopping criterion is satisfied . The worst -case com ‐
plexity order of the proposed algorithm per iteration is 
O(2BN2M). With X̂ (the estimation of X), the active code ‐
words are determined as
X={j:x̂j2
>ϕ,  j∈[2B]},(28)
where ϕ>0 is the threshold .
4 Uncoupled URA Transmission Scheme 
for Complexity Reduction
Since the size of common codebook A grows exponentially 
in B, it is computationally infeasible for any CS algorithm to 
perform AD among the codebook accommodating even small -
sized messages (e.g., B=100 bit). Many URA works take the 
divide -and -conquer strategy and utilize a concatenated coding 
scheme termed CCS . Specifically , each long message bit se ‐
quence is split into several fragments of amenable length for 
slotted transmission . These fragments are coupled by append ‐
ing parity check bits generated by pseudo -random linear com ‐
binations of message bits from previous fragments . The de ‐
coder first determines transmitted fragments of each slot and 
then combines slot -wise fragments into the entire message 
based on a tree decoding process . With the help of the high 
spatial resolution provided by massive MIMO , it is suggested 
in Refs . [13] and [14] that the massive MIMO channels in the 
angular domain already offer adequate information to combine 
fragments scattered among different transmission slots . The 
sparsity and magnitude of each entry of angular domain chan ‐
nel vectors indicate angular propagation patterns unique to 
each active user . Assuming these channel statistics to be al ‐
most unchanged within the URA uplink transmission period , 
the message stitching process can be conducted in the form of 
clustering recovered channels into groups of each active user .
Following the uncoupled URA scheme in Refs . [13] and 
[14], we divide each B-bit message into S fragments of length 
J=B/S, which are encoded for transmission in the coherent 
block of length N=NSS. The designed low -complexity URA 
receiver under CFO in this paper reconstructs the emitted 
message list by taking the following two steps : 1) after each 
transmission slot , performing JADCE to the received signal 
via the proposed MC -PBiGAMP algorithm with downsized 
common coding matrix A͂∈CNS×2J; 2) reconstructing the en ‐
