where dd is the length of the direct path of the transmitter and re ‐
ceiver , dr is the total length of the reflection path of the transmit ‐
ter and receiver , kλ is the wave number , and ζ is the reflection 
coefficient of the ground . In general , ζ=−1，Gl=GaGb, and Gl 
is the total gain of the transmitting and receiving antennas on the 
direct path from the transmitter to the receiver ; Gr=GcGd, and 
Gr is the total gain of the transmitting and receiving antennas 
on the reflective path from the transmitter to the receiver .
The fitting results of the two -path model are shown in Fig . 4.
4 Path Loss Statistical Modeling for Area B
In this section , an empirical model of large -scale fading of 
radio waves is established based on a large number of test samples obtained in the marshalling station Area B . Among 
them , the carrier frequency of the base station is fixed at 
2.6 GHz , and the height of the receiver antenna is fixed at 
1 m. We build a statistical model of Area B utilizing the 
path loss PL, the distance d of the transceiver antenna , and 
the height of the base station antenna ht in the test data .
The path loss formula of the Hata model is as follows :
PLHata=69.55+26.16lg fc-13.82lg ht-α(hr)+
(44.9-6.55lg ht)lgd, (7)

(8)
where fc is the frequency (the unit is MHz ), ht and hr define 
the effective heights of the transmitter antenna and the re ‐
ceiver antenna (the unit is m ), and α(hr) varies with the city 
size (medium and small cities ; large cities ) and frequency (≤
300 MHz or > 300 MHz ).
In different scenarios , the Hata model changes the path loss 
model by adding a correction factor , and the expression after 
adding the correction factor is shown in Eq . (9).
PLHata=Δ1+74.52+26.16lg fc-13.82lg ht-
3.2(lg(11.75hr))2+(Δ2+44.9-6.55lg ht)lgd. (9)
One part of the correction factors Δ1 and Δ2 in the Hata 
model is linear with the logarithm of the height of the transmit ‐
ting antenna , and the rest are the constants in Table 1. The 
correction factors are given by :
ì
í
îΔ1=p1log10(ht)+q1
Δ2=p2log10(ht)+q2, (10)
where p1, p2, q1 and q2 are the undetermined coefficients .
The correction factors Δ1 and Δ2 are fitted to the height of 
the base station antenna based on the calculation results . Tak‐
ing the results of multiple tests as statistical data , we perform 
a least -square (LS) fitting model based on the path loss test 
data of nine cells . The fitting results are shown in Table 2.
