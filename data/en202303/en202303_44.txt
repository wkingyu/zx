quency for the differential quasi -Yagi array in Fig . 8(e) with a 
spacing of 15 mm between the two elements . Note that the 
matching band is from 7.9 GHz to 12.2 GHz and from 8.0 GHz 
to 14.0 GHz , respectively , for the single -ended and differen ‐
tial quasi -Yagi arrays . The maximum coupling level is almost 
the same for the two cases over the respective impedance 
bandwidths .
3.3 Decoupling Structures and Effects
It is seen from Fig . 12 that the simulated mutual coupling 
level for the center -to-center spacing of 15 mm, which is equal 
to the half wavelength at 10 GHz , is –18 dB. For a multiple - 
input and multiple -output (MIMO ) array , the mutual coupling 
level of –25 dB is desirable . Hence , there is a need to further 
reduce the mutual coupling . A few decoupling structures such 
as the neutralization line[13], split -ring resonator[14], slit, and air 
holes have been attempted . The idea to add a meta -surface as 
a superstrate to reduce the mutual coupling has not been ad ‐
opted to keep the low profile of the differential quasi -Yagi ar ‐
ray[15]. The simulated decoupling effects of the above struc ‐
tures are summarized as follows . For the case of the neutraliza ‐
tion line , the coupling level is greatly reduced to −25 dB but 
the radiation patterns are distorted , and the gain is reduced by 
2 dB at 10 GHz . For the case of the split -ring resonator , it fails to 
reduce the coupling level but increase the gain by 0.2–0.7 dB 
over the impedance bandwidth . For the cases of slit and air 
holes , they are very effective to reduce the mutual coupling to 
−25 dB and meanwhile do not affect the impedance bandwidth 
and radiation patterns . Hence , the E -plane linear arrays with 
the slit and air holes are fabricated and measured .
3.4 Results and Discussion
Fig. 13 shows the photos of the two -element differential 
quasi -Yagi arrays without any decoupling structure , with the 
slit, and with the air holes . The two differential quasi -Yagi an ‐
tenna elements are separated by 15 mm and fed with the Sub ‐
miniature version A (SMA )-connected coaxial cables . The slit 
is a 2 mm wide cut in between the two elements and after the 
truncated ground plane . The air holes that have the same di ‐
ameter of 0.5 mm are punched in between the two elements 
and after the truncated ground plane with an optimized pat ‐
tern. It should be mentioned that the details of the SMAs and 
coaxial cables are unknown . The irregular solder joints and 
curved coaxial cables are hard to be modelled exactly . Hence , only measured results are discussed .
