September  2023  Vol.21 No.3ZHANG Bo , WANG Yihui , FENG Yinian , YANG Yonghui , PENG Lin A 220 GHz Frequency -Division Multiplexing Wireless Link with High Data Rate    Research Papers
sign, the 220 GHz frequency -division full duplexer communi ‐
cation system is proposed , which realizes real -time high -speed 
communication with a transmission distance greater than 15 m, 
and uplink and downlink transmission rates of 10.4 Gbit/s , re‐
spectively . The measured BER is lower than 10−7. Furthermore , 
the HD 4K video can be transmitted in real time . This work re ‐
alizes a high -rate and long -range THz communication system 
that has broad application prospects in wireless communica ‐
tion. This paper builds a 220 GHz frequency -division multiplex ‐
ing communication system , which adopts non -coherent demodu ‐
lation to achieve a transmission distance of 15 m, an uplink and 
downlink transmission rate of 10.4 Gbit/s each , and a BER 
lower than 10−7.
