Denote f({V(d)
k}) as the left side of Inequality (12) and 
g(Vk|{V(d)
k}) can be regarded as the lower -bounding function 
which minorizes the objective function f({V(d)
k}), since it is a 
convex function of Vk that satisfies g(Vk|{V(d)
k})≤f({Vk}) 
and g(V(d)
k|{V(d)
k})=f({V(d)
k}). It can be iteratively optimized 
and converge to a stationary point , which has been proved in 
Ref. [22].
The update of Vk for all users can be decoupled across 
transmitters . Then , we update beamforming matrices as 
V() d+1
k =argmax
Vkg()Vk|{}V()d
k, and the optimal solution to the equation is obtained by the Lagrange multipliers method with 
Lagrange multiplier μ. According to the first -order optimal 
conditions , the iterative equation of the beamformer can be ob ‐
tained as
V(d+1)
k =(D(d)
k+μI)-1(αkA(d)
k) , (18)
where
D(d)
k=αkB(d)

m≠kαmC(d)
m , (19)
and μ can be obtained by using the bisection method .
For the last part of B(d)
k and C(d)
m, which have not been trans ‐
formed into the deterministic matrix , there are complicated 
calculations of the random variables , leading to difficulty in 
obtaining closed -form expressions . Drawing on the essence of 
Ref. [23], we will utilize deterministic equivalents to obtain 
the approximate closed -form expression of MIMO capacity , 
and the derivation process is presented as follow .
Note that Rk=E{logdet(I+HkVkVkHHkHQ-1

k as a Hermitian matrix ZNr,k. Let FZNr,k(λ) 
denote the expected cumulative distribution of the eigenvalues 
λ1,⋯, λNr of ZNr, k, and the Shannon transform VZNr,k is de ‐
scribed as VZNr,k(x)=∫0∞
log(1+1
xλ)  dFZNr,k(λ). Then Rk can 
be simplified as ∑Eλi[ ] log(1+λi) and translated into 
Nr∫0∞
log(1+λ)  dFZNr,k(λ), finally equivalent to NrVZNr,k(1). 
The Stieltjes transform for FZNr,k(λ) is
SZNr,k(y)=∫1
y-λdFZNr,k(λ)=1
NrE{tr[(yINr-ZNr,k)-1]}.
(20)
Then the relation between the Stieltjes transform SZNr,k(y) 
and the Shannon transform VZNr,k can be established as
VZNr,k(x)=∫x∞
( )1
y+SZNr,k()-ydy.
(21)
Thus , we can obtain the closed -form expression of the ergo ‐
dic user rate Rk by establishing the closed -form expression of 
the Stieltjes transform and Shannon transform . The approxi ‐
mate closed -form Stieltjes transform expressions can be calcu ‐
lated by applying the free probability theory[24], denoted as 
Eqs. (22) and (23) with Notations (24)–(27).
