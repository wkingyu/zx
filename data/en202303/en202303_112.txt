the primary and secondary windings of the transformer as the 
actual working condition . Fig. 7 shows the schematic dia ‐
gram of the simulation wiring diagram of the actual working 
condition of the full -bridge transformer . The network ana ‐
lyzer Port 1 applies voltage excitation . The excitation output 
terminal of Port 1 is connected to the primary winding point A 
of the full -bridge transformer , and the other excitation output 
reference terminal is connected to the primary winding point 
B of the full -bridge transformer . The network analyzer Port 2 
receives the common mode noise current generated by the 
planar transformer , the signal -receiving terminal of Port 2 is 
connected to the secondary winding point D, and the other 
signal -receiving reference terminal is connected to the pri ‐
mary winding point B.
The measurement result of the network analyzer is the 
scattering matrix , that is , the S-parameter matrix , which de ‐
scribes the relationship between the reflected wave of the 
port voltage and the incident wave . According to the relation ‐
ship between the port voltage and the current , the S-
parameter matrix can be converted into a Z-parameter ma ‐
trix, as shown in Eq . (20).

where S21 and S12 are the transmission coefficients in the 
scattering matrix , S11 and S22 are the reflection coefficients in the scattering matrix , and Z0 is the characteristic impedance .
According to the test principle , the magnetic field of the 
magnetic core of the planar transformer is excited during the 
test, the potential distribution of the primary and secondary 
windings of the transformer is formed , and the leakage mag ‐
netic field between the primary and secondary windings is 
formed . Therefore , the network analyzer measures a two -port 
network containing transformer leakage inductance Lk , exci ‐
tation inductor Lm , and equivalent common -mode capacitors 
C1 and C 2. We simplify the wiring schematic of Fig . 7 and 
obtain an equivalent circuit diagram for measurement as 
shown i n Fig . 8.
According to the circuit theory , the two -port Z-parameter 
can be expressed as :

The test result of the network analyzer is a two -port matrix , 
which makes Fig . 8 further equivalent to the two -port net ‐
work of Fig . 9, and the Z-parameter expression of the two 
ports is shown in Eq . (21). For the reciprocal two -port net ‐
work with three variables Z11, Z12(=Z21), and Z22, three equa ‐
tions can be listed , and three unknowns can be solved theo ‐
retically .
