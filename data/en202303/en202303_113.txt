Therefore , for the above two -port equivalent circuit , first , 
the transformer secondary port CD in Fig . 6 is short -
circuited , and the leakage inductance impedance ZLk is mea ‐
sured using a network analyzer or impedance analyzer . In 
Fig. 9, given  ZLk, opening the port Port 2, we can get Eqs . 
(22) and (23):

Combining Eqs . (22)–(24), we can get the expressions of 
ZLm, ZC1 and ZC2 with ZLk, and Z11, Z12 and Z22 as variables :
ZLm=Z11Z22-Z212-ZLkZ22
Z22-Z21  , (25)
ZC1=Z11Z22-Z212-ZLkZ22
Z21  , (26)
ZC2=Z11Z22-Z212-ZLkZ22
Z11-ZLk-Z21  . (27)
ZLm, ZC1 and ZC2 can be solved according to Eqs . (25)–
(27). After obtaining the impedance curves of the parameters 
ZLm, ZC1, ZC2 and ZLk required for modeling , the circuit pa ‐
rameters of the electromagnetic compatibility equivalent cir ‐
cuit model of the planar transformer are determined by the 
method of circuit model fitting .
4 Planar Transformer Simulation
4.1 Extraction of Material Parameters of Planar Trans ‑
former Core
To obtain the impedance curves of magnetic core materials 
such as inductors and transformers with the help of simula ‐
tion tools , it is first necessary to extract the complex perme ‐
ability of the magnetic core material . The complex permeabil ‐
ity of the magnetic core material has an important influence 
on the electromagnetic compatibility characteristics of mag ‐
netic components , and is of great significance for the product 
design selection of magnetic components and the research on 
electromagnetic compatibility characteristics . Although the data sheets provided by some magnetic core material manu ‐
facturers will include the complex permeability of the mag ‐
netic core material , the complex permeability frequency 
range provided in the data sheet is usually in the range of 
several kHz to several MHz , which cannot completely cover 
the frequency band range of conducted electromagnetic inter ‐
ference research (150 kHz–30 MHz ). Therefore , it is neces ‐
sary to extract the complex permeability of the magnetic core 
material through experimental measurement .
Because the distribution parameters of magnetic compo ‐
nents are very rich , there are distributed capacitances be ‐
tween the magnetic core and the windings , and between the 
windings . To reduce the effect of distributed capacitance on 
complex permeability measurements , the complex permeabil ‐
ity of a magnetic core is measured using a single -turn center ‐
ing method , as sho wn in Fig . 10. The single -turn winding 
uses copper wires with a short length and a major diameter to 
reduce the influence of the winding loss and lead inductance 
of the single -turn winding on the measurement of the com ‐
plex magnetic permeability of the magnetic core .
The impedance characteristic of the single -turn coil is 
measured with an impedance analyzer . The equivalent model 
of the measurement is :
Z=Rs+jωLs, (28)
where Rs and Ls are the equivalent series resistance and 
equivalent series inductance of the magnetic component un ‐
der test , respectively . It can be approximated that the Rs in 
the test result is only generated by the core loss , and  Ls is 
only generated by the magnetic permeability of the magnetic 
core.
Thus according to the definition of complex permeability :
