LDPC in the waterfall region , it has an improvement in the er ‐
ror floor region . The size of the parity check matrix we used 
during the test is 5×29, and the lifting size is 352.
The performance of the matrix with a shorter information 
blocklength of k=2 112 bits is shown in Fig . 7. The lifting size 
is 88. The code we constructed also has the advantage in the 
error floor region .
4.3 Hardware Implementation Results
For LDPC codes with a lifting size of 352, we design the 
corresponding decoder prototype to evaluate and compare the 
hardware resources accurately before and after adding the pro ‐
tograph construction constraints . The decoder consists of buf ‐
fers, a controller , several decoder cores , etc. We use a quanti ‐zation length of 6 bits for the LLR information and 4 bits for 
the internal messages .
The implementation results , as well as the corresponding 
comparisons , are reported in this section . The formula for cal ‐
culating throughput is as follows :
Throughput=R×Ncores×n
Niter×M×fclk , (2)
where R is the code rate , Ncores is the number of decoder cores , 
n is the length of the codeword , M is the number of basic ma ‐
trix rows used for decoding , and Niter is the average number of 
iterations . To achieve the desired throughput with the code , 
the information blocklength of which is 8 448 bits, 3 cores are 
required .
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our optimization 
methods , the synthesis results of decoders with and without ap ‐
plying the optimizations proposed in Sections 2 and 3 are 
listed . We use the architecture from Ref . [15] as the baseline . 
Table 1 summarizes the hardware resources of the decoder 
core on t he Xilinx Virtex UltraScale XCVU 440 field program ‐
mable gate array (FPGA ). The decoder core occupies about 
34.0% of the lookup tables and 1.2% of the flip -flops avail ‐
able on the device . Compared with the architecture used in 
Ref. [15], the proposed decoder reduces the resources of the 
lookup table by about 15%.
5 Conclusions
This paper proposes an RL -LDPC code aiming at next -
generation mobile communication , with a corresponding 
hardware architecture with a throughout up to 100 Gbit/s . In 
this code , the designed structure of the protograph is differ ‐
ent from the conventional 5G NR LDPC basic matrix , and an 
improved code construction algorithm is investigated for bet ‐
ter performance . The decoder implemented in our work can 
achieve a throughput higher than 100 Gbit/s , and compared 
with the traditional architecture , the resources of the lookup 
table are reduced by about 15% on Xilinx Virtex UltraScale 
XCVU 440 FPGA .
