a transmit power of 33 dBm and finally achieved a transmis ‐
sion distance of 27 km with 500 Mbit/s . According to these 
works , the solid -state THz communication technology has 
fully demonstrated its great application potential and research 
value in high -rate wireless communication . However , the ex ‐
ploration of THz communication is still limited to point -to-
point communication . Therefore , the research on the THz 
frequency -division multiplexing wireless link is very impor ‐
tant to THz communication .
In this paper , we propose a 220 GHz frequency -division 
multiplexing communication system , which adopts the classi ‐
cal super outlier architecture , focusing on the design includ ‐
ing a 220 GHz sub -harmonic mixer , duplexer and THz 
frequency -division multiplexing communication system , which 
finally realizes the transmission data rate of 10 Gbit/s for up/
down link over a distance of 15 m.
2 System Architecture
Full duplex communication systems often use a time division 
multiplexing (TDM ) mode , a frequency -division multiplexing 
(FDM ) mode and an isolation mode based on waveguide -guided 
orthogonal couplers[10]. During these modes , FDM is to divide 
the total bandwidth used for the transmission channel into two 
sub -carriers with different frequencies for receiving and trans ‐
mitting . Although the two channels occupy different frequen ‐
cies and large spectrum resources , the THz band has huge spec ‐
trum resources . Therefore , the FDM mode is extremely suitable 
for realizing THz full duplex communication .
In this paper , a 220 GHz full -duplex wireless communica ‐
tion system is built in a frequency -division multiplexing mode , 
and the system block diagram is shown in Fig . 1. The base ‐band signal is upconverted by a C -band frequency conversion 
module , which is filtered out of the upper sideband and fed 
into a THz mixer to upconvert to the THz band , and then fil ‐
tered by a THz duplexer to remove the mirror frequency and 
get the radio frequency (RF) signal . The operating frequency 
of the uplink channel is 197.3–199.9 GHz , and that of the 
downlink channel is 207–213 GHz . The RF link of the com ‐
munication system is shown in Fig . 2. To effectively reduce 
the space occupied by the link , the RF link is connected to 
the duplexer with a curved waveguide .
3 Critical Components of System
3.1 220 GHz Sub -Harmonic Mixer Study
A mixer is a crucial device of a THz communication system 
that uses a nonlinear device of solid -state devices to generate 
an output signal containing multiple frequency components[9]. 
The mixer consists of an RF input structure , a local oscillator 
(LO) input structure , multiple filters , inverted parallel diode
