plate FR 4 is set to 4.4, and the physical diagram and simu ‐
lation model of the planar transformer are show n in Fig . 13. 
The physical diagram of Fig . 13(a) shows that the planar 
transformer of the full -bridge circuit is integrally installed . 
We import the PCB of the full -bridge circuit into the simula ‐
tion software and separate the PCB layout of the winding 
part of the planar transformer to establish the simulation 
model of the planar transformer .
The actual planar transformer magnetic core is composed 
of two magnetic cores . Generally , in order to control the in ‐
ductance of the magnetizing inductance during the produc ‐
tion process , an air gap will be opened on the central column 
of the magnetic core . This air gap is very small and difficult 
to measure accurately , but the size of the air gap can be de ‐
termined by comparing the magnetizing inductance . In the 
simulation , the transformer ’s secondary winding is left open 
and the primary winding is excited , and the input impedance 
curve can be obtained , which includes the magnetizing in ‐
ductance , the leakage inductance and the inter -turn capaci ‐tance of the transformer . Since the planar transformer adopts 
the interleaved winding method , the leakage inductance is 
far smaller than the magnetizing inductance . The input im ‐
pedance curve at a low frequency can be approximately re ‐
garded as the impedance curve of the magnetizing induc ‐
tance . After determining the size of the air gap , we short -
circuit the secondary winding to obtain the leakage induc ‐
tance ZLk impedance curve of the transformer . After that , we 
add excitation according to the measurement method in Fig . 
7 to obtain the Z-parameter impedance curve of the trans ‐
former at two ports , and derive ZLm, ZC1, and ZC2 in the model 
according to Eqs . (25)–(27). The simulation results are 
shown in  Fig. 14.
5 Experimental Verification
We use the full -bridge circuit module in the wireless base 
station power supply as the experimental prototype . The 
rated input voltage of the full -bridge circuit module is 48 V, 
the rated output voltage is 12 V, the rated output current is 
35.8 A, and the operating frequency of the circuit is 170 
kHz. The experimental prototype is show n in Fig . 15. The 
planar transformer used in the experimental prototype is the 
transformer mentioned above . The conduction test of the full 
bridge circuit is shown in Fig . 15.
According to the generation and conduction mechanism of 
common mode noise which is mainly caused by the instanta ‐
neous potential change when the switching device is turned 
on or off , and the distributed capacitance that exists between 
the power supply and ground is affected by the rising and 
falling edges of the switching device voltage , resulting in 
noise currents flowing through the line impedance stabiliza ‐
tion network (LISN ), ground , and P and N lines with the 
same amplitude and direction . The common -mode noise cir ‐
