After filters are designed , every individual filter is directly 
connected through T -junctions[11] to form a multiplexer . The 
machining physical drawing and microscope photo of the inter ‐
nal structure are shown in Fig . 7. The proposed duplexer is 
fabricated by computerized numerical control (CNC ) milling 
technology . The cavity is made of brass with a gold -plated sur ‐
face. The simulation and measured results show that the du ‐
plexer passband is 197–203 GHz and 207–213 GHz , the 
isolation degree is 22.51 dB at 205 GHz , the average in -band 
return loss is less than 15 dB, and the average in -band inser ‐
tion loss (IL) is less than 0.8 dB, which is 0.58 dB at mini ‐
mum , as shown in Fig . 8. Compared with the simulation re ‐
sults, the overall frequency shift is 3 GHz and the isolation de ‐gree is 8 dB worse . However , the single -channel bandwidth is 
not different from the simulation results . The reason may be 
that the length of the resonant cavity in the center of the two 
channels is larger than the simulated value , and the width of 
the coupling window is similar to the simulated value , which 
leads to the same bandwidth and downward frequency shift .
4 Measurement Results
For terahertz wireless communication , the link -budget of 
the system mainly includes transmit power , antenna gain , free 
space loss , and atmospheric attenuation[12]. The received 
power can be calculated as follows :
PR=PT+GT+GR+20lg (c
4πRf)-L0-Lex , (1)
where PT is the transmitter output power in dBm , GT and GR 
are antennas gains , R is the transmission distance , L0 is atmo ‐
spheric attenuation which is less than 0.01 dB, and Lex is an 
excess loss set to 3 dB.
The transmitting antenna and receiving antenna both use 
the WR -4 band lens antenna . The baseband power input to 
the 220 GHz sub -harmonic mixer is less than −10 dBm , and 
combined with the test results in Section 3, we can get the an ‐
tenna transmit power PT less than −20 dBm . Therefore , the 
maximum received power of the receiver is −35.78 dBm .
Receiver sensitivity Si,min, which is the minimum received 
power of the receiver and can be calculated as follows :
Si,min=-174+10lgB+NF+SNR , (2)
where B is signal bandwidth as 2.6 GHz , NF is the receiver 
noise factor that can be calculated from the system cascade 
noise factor calculation formula as 13 dB, and SNR is the 
minimum signal -to-noise ratio required for baseband demodu ‐
lation which requires at least 19 dB using 16QAM modula ‐
tion. Therefore , the receiver sensitivity can be calculated as 
−46.02 dBm . The difference between the received power and 
the receiver sensitivity is 10.24 dB, which means the system 
has a link -budget of 10.24 dB.
The block diagram of the single -channel experiment is 
shown in Fig . 9. The LO signals of the transmitter and receiver 
are both provided by the 110 GHz twelve -octave frequency 
multiplier . The influence of phase white noise at the far end of 
the local oscillator on the communication quality is great[13], 
and the deterioration of phase white noise at the far end of the 
local oscillator with the frequency multiplier is 20 log10(n), so 
the input of the local oscillator signal should reduce its far -
end white noise as much as possible . Compared with a phase -
locked loop (PLL), the phase -locked dielectric resonator oscil ‐
lator (PDRO ) has a better phase noise . Therefore , the input of 
this oscillator selects PDRO at 8.5 GHz and 9 GHz , and its 
phase noise at 1 MHz can reach −131 dBc/Hz .
