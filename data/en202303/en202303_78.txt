to input semantic analysis data into GPT -2 and designed an 
alarm strategy layer . Through these ways , we improved the 
complex log sequence learning ability of the model and re ‐
duced the noise effect on the model prediction . Experimental 
results on two industrial datasets have shown that the false 
alarm rate of the model is significantly reduced , and our frame ‐
work shows good performance in the actual operation scenario .
In the future , we will continue to improve the performance 
of the model on multiple datasets and reduce the dependence 
of the alarm strategy layer on expert experience .
