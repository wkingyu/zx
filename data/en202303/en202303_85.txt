randomness of the objective is to be solved , it is supposed to 
be more complex to conduct . As shown in this figure , the pro ‐
posed one converges a little slower than WMMSE but both be ‐
have almost the same . And the proposed converges within 10 
iterations , which confirms the practicality of our beamforming 
design . Moreover , it is observed that both algorithms take 
more iterations to converge as the SNR increases .
From F igs. 5 and 6, we can observe the averaged sum -rate 
performance of the system under different SNRs for different 
beamforming cases . Firstly , it is easy to notice the perfor ‐
mance gain achieved by the channel prediction , which grows 
as the SNR increases . With the predicted CSI , WMMSE can ‐
not attain equivalent gain compared with our proposed 
method that takes the error into consideration , due to the im ‐
perfection of CSI brought by the prediction errors which cause the performance limitation . The proposed beamforming 
design outperforms WMMSE more as the SNR goes higher . 
Comparing these two figures , we can find that the overall per ‐
formance goes down as the UE velocity increases , with the 
performance gaps from the ideal perfect case to others be ‐
coming larger , but our robust method can maintain certain 
gains under such a severe time -varying effect . The proposed 
design can even achieve more gain against WMMSE with a 
higher velocity .
Fig. 7 shows the sum -rate performance comparisons during 
the DL time slot within the half -frame period . The statistics of 
each DL time slot plotted in the figure are obtained by averag ‐
ing 100 periods . As time goes by , the outdating of acquired
