mit link , the baseband signal is first upconverted by the C -band 
frequency conversion module , filtered out of the upper sideband 
and then fed into the THz mixer to be upconverted to the THz 
band , and then filtered out of the mirror frequency by the THz 
duplexer . In the receive link , the RF signal enters the THz 
mixer after the duplexer and is down -converted to the interme ‐
diate frequency (IF) signal . It is then down -converted to the 
baseband signal by the C -band frequency conversion module 
and demodulated after amplification and filtering . The transmit 
and receive links are connected with a THz adjustable attenua ‐
tor for simulating the propagation loss of THz signals in free 
space . The relationship between different baseband power and 
the SNR is demonstrated in Fig . 11(a), which shows that there 
is no significant change in the demodulation SNR with the base ‐
band power above −15 dBm and when the baseband power is 
below −20 dBm , the SNR deteriorates further . Fig. 11(b) shows 
the relationship between the demodulation SNR and BER .
The constellation diagrams corresponding to different SNRs 
are demonstrated in Fig . 12, which shows that the communica ‐
tion results are basically the same when the LO frequency is 
204 GHz and 216 GHz . Keeping the above test platform un ‐
changed , the baseband modulation mode is changed to
