September  2023  Vol.21 No.3LI Hanwen , BI Ningjing , SHA Jin Research Papers   Design of Raptor -Like LDPC Codes and High Throughput Decoder Towards 100 Gbit/s Throughput
eration is finished . The early termination function in the de ‐
coding process is implemented by LLR_pblk , which can cal ‐
culate the parity check result of the current layer . When all 
the parity checks are satisfied , the decoding will stop suc ‐
cessfully and enter the waiting state for the decision informa ‐
tion output .
4 Implementation Results
4.1 Results of Improved Error Floor
We build a compute unified device architecture (CUDA )-
based code performance testing platform , including a noise 
generator , a decoder , and a decoding result statistics module . 
Noise is added directly to the all -zero codeword to improve 
throughput during testing . And we test the code performance 
on a single GeForce GTX 1080  Ti GPU .
We evaluate the performance of the proposed LDPC codes 
in the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN ) channel using 
quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK ) modulation . The belief 
propagation (BP) flooding decoding schedule is used and the 
maximum number of iterations is set to 50.
Compared with the 5G NR LDPC code and the PEG code , 
the code performance constructed by our algorithm has a cer ‐
tain optimization effect , as shown in Fig . 6. As we reduce the 
number of 6 cycles , the error floor is optimized .4.2 Optimized LDPC Code Performance
After applying the code constraints , the code is constructed 
using the construction algorithm described above , and perfor ‐
mance curves with an information blocklength of k=8 448 bits 
are shown in Fig . 7. Although the code we constructed still 
has a gap of less than 0.05 dB compared with the 5G NR
