also find that AC -DCRS outperforms FCR , HPFCR , and DCR 
in these two aspects . This is because AC -DCRS can well bal ‐
ance the call admission of all services from the level of the en ‐
tire system . Ensuring the admission of high -priority service 
calls makes as many calls of multiple services as possible get 
admission .
We assume that the total call arrival rate changes dynami ‐
cally at a certain time frequency . The initial total call arrival 
rate is 8 calls/s , and the range of change is [λt-2, λt+2], 
where λt is the current total call arrival rate . As shown in Fig . 7, 
the AC -DCRS can achieve better system performance in differ ‐
ent dynamic scenarios , compared with comparison algorithms . 
This is because our AC -DCRS can learn the optimal admis ‐
sion control strategy under the current traffic and can adjust 
the threshold in real time .Finally , we show the convergence of the value function in 
the AC -DCRS algorithm . We separately consider the conver ‐
gence in the small state space (C = 20) and big state space (C=
100) cases . We observe the dynamic change of the state -value 
function at a certain state as the Critic evolves . As shown in 
Fig. 8, we can find that after certain training steps , the value 
function converges . The convergence speed varies with the 
sizes of state space , for the reason that it requires more itera ‐
tions to traverse a larger state space to reach optimal strategy . 
In addition , the obtained strategy through training can be ap ‐
plied to similar scenarios in different satellite beam cells . The 
training data of different satellite beam cells in similar sce ‐
narios can be shared for migration training , which will acceler ‐
ate the convergence to the optimal strategy .
5 Conclusions
In this paper , we have proposed a dynamic channel reserva ‐
tion strategy AC -DCRS based on the Actor -Critic algorithm to 
realize intelligent admission control in a satellite network . AC -
DCRS can learn an optimal admission policy for both new 
calls and handover calls with different service priorities , 
which will improve the performance of both the user side and 
the network . Numerical results show that our proposed AC -
DCRS algorithm achieves better long -term overall system per ‐
formance , average call success rate , and channel utilization 
under different traffic conditions and dynamic scenarios com ‐
pared with traditional channel reservation strategies .
