10 GHz . It is evident from the figure that the surface wave of 
the TE0 mode has been strongly excited and trapped in the un ‐
grounded substrate region . It is important to note that the 
grounded substrate region cuts off the surface wave of the TE0 
mode and forces it to be reflected to the ungrounded substrate 
region . The reflected surface wave of the TE0 mode is an im ‐
portant source of mutual coupling . Then , we add two directors 
in the model , and the simulated electric field distribution on 
the top surface of the substrate at 10 GHz is shown in Fig . 8
(b). It is seen that there is a strong desirable coupling between 
the excited driver and its director due to the surface wave of 
the TE0 mode for end -fire radiation . There seems no effect by 
the directors on the coupling between the two drivers . Next , we 
add CPS lines in the model and move the lumped port to the 
CPS input and the matched load to the other CPS input . Fig. 8
(c) shows the simulated electric field distribution on the top 
surface of the substrate at 10 GHz . Note that the CPS lines en ‐
hance the coupling between the two drivers . Finally , we add in 
the model baluns to realize the single -ended quasi -Yagi array 
and TCML to realize a differential quasi -Yagi array , respec ‐
tively . Figs . 8(d) and 8(e) show the simulated electric field dis ‐
tributions on the top surfaces of the substrates at 10 GHz for 
the cases of the single -ended and differential quasi -Yagi ar ‐
rays, respectively . Note that the coupling is stronger for the 
differential than for the single -ended quasi -Yagi array .
Fig. 9 shows the simulated | Sdd11| and | Sdd21| as a function of 
frequency for the cases in Figs . 8(a) and 8(b) with a spacing 
of 15 mm between the two elements . As expected , the cou ‐
pling level over the acceptable matching band from 9 GHz to 
11.5 GHz  is almost the same between the two cases with and 
without the directors . Fig. 10 shows the simulated | Sdd11| and 
|Sdd21| as a function of frequency for the case in Fig . 8(c) with a 
spacing of 15 mm between the two elements . Note that the 
CPS extends the matching band to 15 GHz and reduces the 
coupling level over a wider bandwidth .
