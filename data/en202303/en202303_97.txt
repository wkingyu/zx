The analog beamformer with any arbitrary fixed hybrid archi ‐
tecture can be represented by :
FRF=FFC
RF⊙Up, (1)
WRF=WFC
RF⊙Uc, (2)
where FFC
RF and WFC
RF represent the analog precoder and com ‐
biner with the FC architecture , respectively .
We consider four hybrid architectures for analog beam ‐
forming as depicted in Fig . 2. In the FC architecture shown in 
Fig. 2(a), each RF chain is connected to all antenna elements 
so that a total of NtNt
RF phase shifters are required . In the PC 
architecture shown in Fig . 2(b), each RF chain is connected 
to an antenna subarray while each antenna is connected to 
only one RF chain , so that a total number of Nt phase shifters 
are required . In the OL architecture shown in Fig . 2(c), the 
antenna subarrays connected to each RF chain can overlap , where the overlapped antennas are connected to multiple RF 
chains at the same time . The number of phase shifters re ‐
quired lies between [Nt, NtNt
RF]. In the PC -dynamic architec ‐
ture based on a switch network in Fig . 2(d), the partition of 
the antenna subarrays can be dynamically adjusted by turn ‐
ing on or off the switches according to the system state , and a 
total number of Nt phase shifters and NtNt
RF switches are re ‐
quired .
The transmitted signal at the k-th subcarrier via Nt anten ‐
nas is represented by xk=FRFFBB, ksk, where FBB, k and FRF 
satisfy the power constraint  FRFFBB, k2
F≤1. After passing 
through the channel matrix at the k-th subcarrier Hk∈CNr × Nt, 
the signals reach the receiver which is equipped with Nr anten ‐
nas. The received signals are first processed by an analog com ‐
biner WRF∈CNr × Nt
RF, which is also shared by all subcarriers . 
Then , after removing CPs and performing the fast Fourier 
transform , a digital combiner WBB, k∈CNt
RF × Ns is deployed at ▲Figure 1. Downlink single -user mmWave multiple -input multiple -output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO -OFDM ) system with
