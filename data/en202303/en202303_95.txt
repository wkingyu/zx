Abstract : Hybrid beamforming (HBF ) has become an attractive and important technology in massive multiple -input multiple -output (MIMO ) 
millimeter -wave (mmWave ) systems . There are different hybrid architectures in HBF depending on different connection strategies of the 
phase shifter network between antennas and radio frequency chains . This paper investigates HBF optimization with different hybrid architec ‐
tures in broadband point -to-point mmWave MIMO systems . The joint hybrid architecture and beamforming optimization problem is divided 
into two sub -problems . First , we transform the spectral efficiency maximization problem into an equivalent weighted mean squared error mini ‐
mization problem , and propose an algorithm based on the manifold optimization method for the hybrid beamformer with a fixed hybrid archi ‐
tecture . The overlapped subarray architecture which balances well between hardware costs and system performance is investigated . We fur ‐
ther propose an algorithm to dynamically partition antenna subarrays and combine it with the HBF optimization algorithm . Simulation results 
are presented to demonstrate the performance improvement of our proposed algorithms .
Keywords : hybrid beamforming ; hybrid architecture ; weighted mean square error ; manifold optimization ; dynamic subarrays

1 Introduction
Millimeter -wave (mmWave ) communication has 
emerged as a key technology for fifth -generation 
(5G) wireless networks to cope with the dilemma 
between scarce sub -6 GHz spectrum resources 
and people ’s rapidly growing demand for higher data trans ‐
mission[1–4]. MmWave ’s short wavelength makes it conve ‐
nient to arrange large -scale antenna arrays at the transceiver 
end to compensate for the high propagation loss , and thus 
massive multiple -input and multiple -output (MIMO ) be‐
comes attractive in mmWave systems . However , conven ‐
tional fully digital beamforming (FDBF ) requires a separate 
radio frequency (RF) chain for each antenna and will result 
in huge hardware costs and power consumption in massive 
MIMO systems[5]. Therefore , hybrid beamforming (HBF ) that 
requires very few RF chains has become a research hotspot 
recently[6–8].HBF has different hybrid architectures depending on differ ‐
ent connection strategies between antennas and RF chains . 
The fully -connected (FC) architecture and the partially -
connected (PC) architecture are two conventional hybrid archi ‐
tectures . Most previous works considered the FC architecture . 
In Ref . [9], the authors applied the orthogonal matching pur ‐
suit algorithm to design the column vectors of the analog pre ‐
coding matrix based on codebooks . The authors in Ref . [10] 
proposed an HBF algorithm based on the coordinate update it ‐
eration method in the narrowband point -to-point MIMO sys ‐
tem. The authors in Ref . [11] proposed an alternating minimi ‐
zation algorithm based on manifold optimization (MO) by mini ‐
mizing the Frobenius norm between the HBF matrix and the 
FDBF matrix . The authors in Ref . [12] took the mean square 
error minimization as the optimization goal and the designed 
HBF algorithms based on MO and generalized eigenvalue de ‐
composition (EVD ).
On the other hand , the PC architecture , where each antenna 
is only connected to only one RF chain instead of all RF 
chains , can reduce the power consumption and hardware costs 
compared with the FC architecture at the cost of certain sys ‐
tem performance loss . A low -complexity HBF optimization al ‐
