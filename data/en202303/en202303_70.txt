64QAM and the attenuator is adjusted to make the best perfor ‐
mance . Then the performance at the LO frequency of 204 GHz 
and 216 GHz are tested respectively .
The THz attenuation is removed so that the transmitter 
and the receiver are directly connected back -to-back . The 
PDRO at the receiver side is replaced as the signal source is 
input to achieve the effect of transmitting and receiving LO 
frequency offset by changing the signal source input . The 
range of frequency offset measurement is 0–1 MHz with a 
step of 0.1 MHz . The variation of SNR with the amount of fre ‐
quency offset is shown in Fig . 13. The baseband signal in the 
receiving section is a single sideband . The LO frequency bias 
corresponds to the overall offset of the baseband spectrum and 
there is no signal crossover . Therefore , as long as the fre ‐
quency bias is less than the threshold , the SNR is basically 
unchanged . When the frequency offset exceeds the threshold 
value , the SNR deteriorates sharply and the BER is 1.
After measurement , the frequency bias threshold of this 
communication system is 2.5 MHz . The photograph of the com ‐
munication experiment is shown in Fig . 14. The corresponding 
constellation diagram is shown in Fig . 15, where the demodu ‐
lation SNR of the uplink channel is 22.91 dB when the LO fre ‐
quency is 204 GHz and the demodulation SNR of the down ‐
link channel is 23.19 dB when it is 216 GHz . The BER is less 
than 10−8. The final transmission distance of this communica ‐
tion system is 15 m, which can reach 20 m by calculation be ‐cause of spare capacity in the link . The comparison of the pre ‐
viously published THz wireless links with ours is shown in 
Table 1.
5 Conclusions
In this paper , the front -end key components including a 
220 GHz sub -harmonic mixer and a 220 GHz duplexer are de ‐
signed for the application requirements of the THz frequency -
division multiplexing communication system . The sub -
harmonic mixer is designed based on the domestic Schottky di ‐
ode, which has a fixed fundamental frequency of 204 GHz and 
216 GHz . The frequency conversion loss is less than 10.5 dB 
at 20 GHz . The 220 GHz duplexer is designed based on the 
principle of the cavity filter . The range of the duplexer pass ‐
band is 197–203 GHz and 207–213 GHz , and the return 
loss in the common port is less than 15 dB, which can effec ‐
tively divide the channel of the communication system and 
suppress the mirror frequency . Based on the above circuit de ‐
