According to the results of the nine cells in the marshalling 
yard scenario , we fit the optimal regression model under each 
cell through linear regression , including the corresponding con ‐
stant term and path loss exponent n, and then calculate the cor ‐
responding correction factor for each cell . By conducting joint 
analysis of the height information of base stations in the corre ‐
sponding cell , it is determined whether there is a significant 
linear relationship between the correction factors (Δ1 and Δ2) 
and the height of the base station antenna . The fitting results 
are shown in Figs . 5 and 6. The correction factors are given by :
Δ1=-141.73, (11)
Δ2=17.64lght-17.22. (12)
5 Validation and Evaluation
The empirical model proposed in this paper is compared 
with several traditional empirical models that are improved 
Hata models as well . The traditional empirical models includ ‐
ing the Stanford University temporary model (SUI) and the 
Hata -Okumura extended model are selected as the reference 
model for comparison and verification . The validation data consist of three cells , and the validation data have the same 
measurement system as the statistical modeling data . The vali ‐
dation data are not used in statistical modeling , so they can be 
used to verify the accuracy and generalizability of the model .
The SUI model , Hata -Okumura extended model and statisti ‐
cal model are represented by Model 1, Model 2 and Model 3, 
respectively . Fig. 7 shows a comparison of the accuracy of dif ‐
ferent models on the validation data at different prediction er ‐
ror sensitivities . When the maximum prediction error sensitiv ‐
ity is required to be 10 dB, the maximum prediction accuracy 
of the SUI model is 61.66%, that of the Hata -Okumura model 
is 59.55%, and that of the statistical model is 59.55% with an 
accuracy of 71.06%. In this scenario , compared with the exist ‐
ing SUI and Hata -Okumura models , the accuracy of the self -
built statistical model is improved by about 11.06%. However , 
the prediction accuracies of the SUI model , the Hata -
Okumura extended model and the self -built model in the mar ‐
shalling yard scenario are not much different , indicating that 
the SUI model and the Hata -Okumura extended model have ▼Table 2. Fitting measurement results
