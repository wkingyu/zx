obtained through SRS in the i-th half -
frame and HDt
i, k∈CNr×Nt as the CSI ma ‐
trix for DL transmission in the t-th DL 
time slot of the i-th half -frame period . 
As illustrated in Fig . 2, the whole pro ‐
cedure of channel acquisition can be 
divided into three steps , which are 
channel estimation , channel prediction 
and interpolation . Based on the chan ‐
nel prediction algorithm and interpola ‐
tion for the DL channel between the 
currently estimated channel and the 
predicted one , HDt
i, k used for DL beam ‐
forming depends on the predicted DL 
channel matrix ĤDt
i, k, and the channel 
prediction error is considered further .
2.1 Channel Prediction
In the TDD system , firstly , by ex ‐
ploiting the reciprocity between UL 
and DL , we can obtain the uplink 
channel information by channel esti ‐
mation such as minimum mean square 
error (MMSE ) and least square (LS), 
and use them to calculate parameters 
including beamforming for DL trans ‐
mission . The channel estimation is to 
diminish the effect of noise and ex ‐
tract the channel model from received 
data. In this paper , we assume the 
channel estimation is perfect and we 
can obtain the estimated CSI for UE 
HS
i,1, HS
i,2,⋯, HS
i,K through the process ‐
ing of SRS .
Then , based on a certain number of past CSI samples , we 
can predict the future state of channels for UE 
ĤS
i+1,1, ĤS
i+1,2,⋯, ĤS
i+1,K by exploiting the correlation charac ‐
teristics of the channels . In this paper , to track nonlinear chan ‐
nels and predict the time -varying channel , we adopt a sparse 
sliding -window KRLS algorithm , where the sample set is up ‐
dated dynamically based on the correlation analysis among 
samples . And it is to be mentioned that the proposed beam ‐
forming scheme in the following is not limited to a certain pre ‐
diction method .
During the special time slot for SRS , with the currently esti ‐
mated channel and predicted one ĤS
i+1, k, the next step is to in ‐
terpolate the DL channel between them and here we take the 
linear interpolation method . Define τ and Nslot as the number 
of DL time slots and that of the total slots in one half -frame , re‐
spectively . Assuming that besides the DL time slots there is 
one SRS slot and two UL slots , with the detail of the time slot 
structure shown in Fig . 3, the deployed linear interpolation is 
expressed asĤDt

2.2 Channel Prediction Error Model
Considering that the predicted channels obtained by chan ‐
nel prediction techniques still exist errors inevitably , com ‐
pared with the real channels , we take channel prediction er ‐
rors into consideration and introduce an error model . With HS
i,k 
denoting the perfect estimated CSI for the k-th piece of UE in 
the i-th SRS period , the former channel prediction errors col ‐
lected can be described as

and a sliding -window size w is set for collection , as shown 
in Fig . 3. By exploiting the statistical characteristics of 
the historical channel prediction error sample set
