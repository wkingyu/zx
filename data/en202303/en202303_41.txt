them . Thereby , the surface wave of the TE0 mode is guided to 
radiate in the end -fire direction . On the other hand , due to the 
existence of the ground plane or the reflector , the surface wave 
of the TE0 mode cannot be propagated in the grounded sub ‐
strate region and will be reflected , which further strengthens 
the radiation in the end -fire direction .
It should be pointed out that the surface wave of the TM0 
mode is quite weakly excited , which can propagate along the 
axial directions of the driver in both the grounded and un ‐
grounded substrate regions . It causes cross -polarized radia ‐
tion and deteriorates antenna gain and front -to-back ratio . 
Therefore , in designing a quasi -Yagi antenna , the major con ‐
cern is how to excite the surface waves of the TE0 mode to the 
greatest extent and the surface waves of the TM0 mode to the 
lowest extent .
Fig. 4 shows the simulated and measured | Sdd11| of the dif ‐
ferential quasi -Yagi antenna as a function of frequency from 
7 GHz to 15 GHz . It is evident 
from the figure that although there 
are differences between the simu ‐
lated and measured values , the an ‐
tenna achieves acceptable match ‐
ing from 7.5 GHz to 14.8 GHz or a 
fractional bandwidth of 66% for a 
voltage standing wave ratio ≤ 2 at 
11.15 GHz . Fig. 5 shows the simu ‐
lated and measured radiation pat ‐
terns at 8.2 GHz , 10.6 GHz , and 
12.3 GHz . As expected , the an ‐
tenna radiates an end -fire beam . 
Fig. 6 shows the simulated and 
measured gain values . The mea ‐
sured gain values fluctuate be ‐
tween 3.7 dBi and 5.4 dBi from 
8 GHz  to 12.3 GHz . The simu ‐
lated radiation efficiency is 94% 
at 10 GHz . The simulated radia ‐
tion efficiency at frequencies be ‐
low 8 GHz and above 13.5 GHz drops quickly , which explains 
why the gain drops .
Table 1 lists the bandwidth , gain , efficiency , cross -
polarization (X-pol), and front -to-back ratio (FBR ) for the 
single -ended and differential quasi -Yagi antennas at 10 GHz . 
It should be mentioned that these quasi -Yagi antennas have 
the same size and are fabricated with the same material . Note 
from the table that the differential quasi -Yagi antenna outper ‐
forms the single -ended counterparts .
3 Differential Quasi -Yagi Array
The application of the differential quasi -Yagi antenna as an 
array element is explored in this section . We limit our effort to 
E-plane linear arrays because we target their potential use in 
portable and mobile devices[11–12].
