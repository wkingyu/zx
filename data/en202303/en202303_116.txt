cuit of the full -bridge circuit is shown in Fig . 16. There are 5 
main potential jump points , of which the four potential jump 
points are the 4 terminals of the transformer . Part of the 
common -mode noise current at the two potential trip points 
on the primary side of the transformer conducts the common -
mode noise current to ground through the switching device ’s 
coupling capacitor to the ground , and the other part of the 
common -mode noise current is transmitted from the primary 
side to the secondary side through the interturn capacitance 
of the transformer through the potential change of the trans ‐
former primary side and the secondary side winding , and 
then flows into the earth , LISN , and back to the primary side . 
For the two potential jump points on the secondary side of 
the transformer , since the secondary side is connected to the 
ground , the common -mode noise current flowing through the 
coupling capacitor between the switching device and ground 
flows directly back on the secondary side without flowing 
through the LISN .
According to the substitution theorem , the switches Q1, Q3, 
Q6, and Q7 and the output inductor Lo are equivalent to cur ‐
rent sources , and the switches Q2, Q4, Q5, and Q8 are equiva ‐
lent to voltage sources . The input capacitor Cin and the out ‐
put capacitor Co can be regarded as a short circuit due to 
their small impedance , and the common mode impedance 
Zcm of the LISN can be regarded as 25 Ω. The equivalent cir ‐
cuit diagram after the application of the substitution theorem 
is shown in Fig . 17.
When the current sources work together , all voltage 
sources are short -circuited , and an equivalent circuit dia ‐
gram can be obtained . The primary current source is short -
circuited , the voltage at the transformer port is 0, and the sec ‐
ondary side current source is connected in parallel across 
the secondary winding of the transformer , which is also short -
circuited . All current sources are short -circuited when the 
current source is active , and no common mode noise current 
is formed in Zcm . The equivalent circuit diagram consider ‐
ing only the current source is shown in Fig . 18.
When the voltage sources work together , open all current 
sources to obtain the equivalent circuit diagram . The equiva ‐lent circuit diagram considering only the voltage sources is 
shown in Fig . 19. Q2, Q4 and Q8 will generate common mode 
noise current on Zcm. Using the superposition theorem for the 
voltage sources Q2, Q4, and Q8, the common -mode noise volt ‐
