Qp1s1=Cp1s1(vp1m-vs1m), (6)
where Cp1s1 is the total structural capacitance between P1 and 
S1, vp1m is the midpoint voltage of P1, and vs1m is the midpoint 
voltage of S1.
In the same way , the charge QP2S1 stored between the sec ‐
ond turn P2 of the primary winding and the secondary wind ‐
ing S1 is:
Qp2s1=Cp2s1(vp2m-vs1m), (7)
where Cp2s1 is the total structural capacitance between P2 and 
S1, and vp2m is the midpoint voltage of P2.
The charge QP3S1 stored between the third turn P3 of the 
primary winding and the secondary winding S1 is:
Qp3s1=Cp3s1(vp3m-vs1m), (8)
where Cp3s1 is the total structural capacitance between P3 and 
S1, and vp3m is the midpoint voltage of P3.
Then the charge Qall stored between the primary and sec ‐
ondary windings of the entire planar transformer can be ex ‐
pressed as :
Qall=Qp

From the perspective of the entire planar transformer , the 
planar transform er in Fig . 4 has four endpoints : A, B, C, and 
D, where A and C are ends with the same name . According to 
the relationship between the voltage ratio of the primary and 
secondary sides of the transformer and the turn ratio , it can 
be known that the voltage drop Δvp per turn of the primary winding of the transformer is the same as the voltage drop 
Δvs per turn of the secondary winding . If the voltage drop per 
turn is Δv, then we have :
Δv=vp
Np=vs
NS,
(10)
where vp is the port voltage of the entire primary winding of 
the planar transformer , vs is the port voltage of the entire sec ‐
ondary winding of the planar transformer , Np is the number of 
turns of the primary winding of the planar transformer , and 
Ns is the number of turns of the secondary winding of the pla ‐
nar transformer . According to the stacked structure of the 
planar transformer , Np takes 3 and Ns takes 1.
Considering the voltage distribution of the planar trans ‐
former winding in Fig . 4, it is only necessary to select the 
voltage of a certain point on the primary winding of the trans ‐
former as the voltage reference point , and the potential of 
any other point can be expressed by the voltage reference 
point and the voltage drop Δv per turn ; the same is true for 
the secondary winding .
The point inside the transformer winding is used as the 
voltage reference point . When modeling , the model of the 
transformer needs to be split , which complicates the model ‐
ing. Therefore , in order to simplify the modeling , the four ter ‐
minals A, B, C, and D of the transformer are used as alterna ‐
tive voltage reference points . By selecting point B of the pri ‐
mary winding and point  D of the secondary winding as the po ‐
tential reference points , the midpoint potentials vp
1m, vp
2m, vp
3m 
and vS
1m of each turn winding in the planar transformer can 
be expressed as :
vp
1m=vB+2.5Δv,(11)
vp
2m=vB+1.5Δv,(12)
vp
3m=vB+0.5Δv,(13)
