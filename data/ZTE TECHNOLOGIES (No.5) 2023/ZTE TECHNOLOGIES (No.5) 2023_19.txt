of "value-centric network construction and 
intelligent planning" to meet the diversi/f_ied 
requirements of the global communications 
industry. ZTE integrates AI technology into its 
network planning tool to enable intelligent 
identi/f_ication of traﬃc suppression cells, 
intelligent forecasting of business volume 
growth with a 90% accuracy rate, and 
intelligent pre-evaluation of planning eﬀects.
ZTE continuously enhances the planning 
capability of its tool for speci/f_ic scenarios. 
For example, it can generate building 
pro/f_iles intelligently and accurately 
identify the buildings that lack 5G indoor 
distribution. The multi-site-type planning 
function facilitates the reasonable layout 
and eﬃcient coordination of macro base 
stations, micro base stations, and indoor 
distribution base stations. Moreover, ZTE 
introduces user perception data-driven 
planning in addition to coverage and 
capacity-driven planning. This approach allows for the accurate setting of cell-level 
capacity expansion thresholds, achieving a 
win-win situation between investment and 
user experience.
Digital and Intelligent Deployment 
of Sites
Site construction, reconstruction, 
testing, optimization, and acceptance are 
core activities in network deployment. 
ZTE utilizes intelligent tools and digital 
platforms, along with fast and /f_lexible 
programming and orchestration capabilities, 
to enable digital and intelligent site delivery. 
During the site construction phase, 
automation in operations, multi-team 
management, and multi-position 
coordination are highly demanded to 
ensure engineering quality and progress. 
This requires the use of intelligent tools 
to simplify operations and improve
