& inferencecomputing resources and enhanced 
computing resources within multiple base 
stations can be pooled and aggregated 
through transmission, enabling dynamic 
sharing and collaborative orchestration 
of computing power across base stations. 
This achieves load balancing and eﬃcient 
utilization of computing resources. The 
combination of computing power at the 
base station level with the computing power 
of intelligent modules on the network 
management side and an independent 
intelligent platform forms the foundation for 
distributed native computing capabilities.
In the realm of data, standardized data 
collection processes and a uni/f_ied data 
model are employed for data collection, 
cleansing, correlation, and labeling within 
the RAN system. This enables the generation 
and maintenance of modeled data such as 
user pro/f_iles and base station pro/f_iles. Model 
training and inference for native intelligence 
within the RAN system is eﬃciently 
supported by combining distributed data 
services with domain knowledge as well as 
model knowledge. 
In the dimension of algorithms, the 
real-time intelligent engine deployed at 
the base station side supports extremely 
lightweight model training and near-real-time 
model inference. It improves network 
eﬃciency and user experience through 
precise prediction and proactive optimization. 
On the network management side, Intelligent Service Exposure Empowers 
Multi-Dimensional Applications
ZTE’s RAN intelligence architecture 
consists of three layers: physical network 
layer, intelligent service layer, and intelligent 
application layer (Fig. 1). These three layers 
enable native intelligence within the wireless 
network and empower operators to achieve 
cross-domain closed-loop operations, 
cross-domain collaborative computing, and 
cross-domain service orchestration.
The physical network layer encompasses all 
hardware infrastructure and raw data sources 
that form the basis for native intelligence 
within RAN. It includes various devices such as 
base stations, network management systems, 
intelligent platforms, as well as a diverse range 
of data resources from terminals or relay nodes 
such as mobile phones, wearable devices, 
connected cars, drones, ATG aircraft, and 
satellites. These resources facilitate interaction 
with the intelligent service layer through data 
collection and policy delivery.
The intelligent service layer utilizes 
the computing and data resources from 
the physical network layer to model and 
orchestrate computing capabilities and govern 
data. It employs various algorithm models 
to orchestrate intelligent atomic capabilities, 
and ultimately exposes computing power, 
data, and algorithms in the form of services 
to the application layer.
