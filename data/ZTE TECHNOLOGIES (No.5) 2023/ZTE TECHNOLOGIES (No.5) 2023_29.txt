Opening the Door of “Intelligence” 
Through Craftsmanship Network 
Construction
With the large-scale deployment of 5G 
networks, communication networks become 
increasingly complex, demands are fragmented 
and diversi/f_ied, and the coexistence of 
multiple standards and frequency bands has 
greatly increased the operational diﬃculty. 
Coordinating cloud network resources faces 
many challenges. Therefore,  the adoption of AI 
technologies to accelerate network intelligence 
has emerged as a prevailing trend and an 
industry-wide consensus. 
ZTE demonstrated its new-generation 
autonomous network solution uSmartNet 
2.0 at MWC Barcelona 2023. The solution 
aims to help operators accelerate their 
journey towards level 4 (L4) automation. 
ZTE’s “Craftsmanship Network” construction 
solution focuses on ubiquitous connections, 
intelligent O&M, and agile operation in 
value-driven scenarios through the uSmartNet 
2.0 system. By leveraging the power of big 
data and AI, it creates an intelligent brain 
that operates at multiple levels, starting from 
intrinsic network elements, single-domain 
automation, to cross-domain collaboration. 
This solution provides automation capability 
through layered, domain-based, and 
hierarchical evolution, achieving a fast 
service-driven closed loop. By using intelligent 
O&M tools such as VMAX, RNIA, and CNIA, 
craftsmanship networks greatly optimize user 
perception delay and enable alarm root cause 
diagnosis and potential fault identi/f_ication. 
This not only helps operators increase their 
network automation, but also greatly improves 
eﬃciency and quality in network deployment, 
optimization, and maintenance. Currently, 
ZTE has cooperated with over 80 partners 
across more than 100 global sites, maintaining 
industry leadership in areas such as big data, AI, and deep packet inspection (DPI).
Achieving the Goal of “Surpassing” in 
Craftsmanship Network Construction
As the construction of “Craftsmanship 
Network” continues to progress, ZTE and its 
customers are working closely, paying keen 
attention to the latest technology trends 
and industry standards, and addressing 
network weaknesses by establishing up 
innovative topics and sharing research 
results. In China, ZTE partners with China 
Mobile, China Telecom, and China Unicom 
to jointly build “Leading Cities”, and has won 
the Communication Network Optimization 
Excellent Project Award from the China 
Association of Communication Enterprises. 
Internationally, ZTE understands the unique 
needs and challenges of operators in diﬀerent 
countries, helping them achieve top rankings 
in multiple internationally recognized 
benchmarking tests. This has earned them a 
strong market reputation and driven business 
growth, fostering win-win cooperation. For/uni00A0

ZTE has long been committed to serving 
industry-leading telecom operators. Through 
the “Craftsmanship Network” construction, it 
continually deepens its strategic cooperation 
with operators, strengthens technological 
innovation collaboration, and upgrades 
from traditional order-based procurement 
models to a new cooperative R&D approach. 
At present, ZTE has built high-performance 
“Craftsmanship Networks” in more than 100 
countries and regions, securing operators’ 
leading positions in the industry, facilitating 
their digital transformation, and achieving a 
win-win situation.
