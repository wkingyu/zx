Service OﬃceLiang AoAZTE Supports AIS in Smart Network 
Construction and Intelligent O&M
IS is a leading mobile operator 
in Thailand, with over 46 million 
subscribers nationwide. In 
the digital era, the rapid 
development of the information and 
communication industry has dramatically 
changed people's production and life 
styles. As an industry leader, AIS is 
committed to providing high-quality 
mobile communications services for users in 
Thailand. 
ZTE, as the world's leading provider of 
integrated communications and information 
technology solutions, has been assisting AIS 
in building the 3G network since as early as 
2010. ZTE also helped AIS in deploying its 
4G network on a large scale, which was put 
into commercial use in 2015. In early 2020, 
AIS began to build its 5G network, which has 
basically achieved full 5G coverage in urban 
areas and is actively promoting the maturity 
of the end-to-end 5G industry. However, the 
coexistence of multiple 2/3/4/5G frequency 
bands in AIS’s network has made the equipment type and network architecture 
complicated, posing great challenges to 5G 
network construction and O&M. 
As a strategic partner of AIS, ZTE has 
developed an end-to-end intelligent solution 
for AIS in network construction and O&M. 
This solution covers single-domain precision 
planning, automatic AAPC antenna weight 
optimization, VDT, NQI, cross-domain 
complaint handling supported by VMAX-S 
big data platform, and self-intelligence 
implementation. It eﬀectively improves 
network delivery eﬃciency, reduces network 
maintenance diﬃculties, and reduces 
network O&M costs. 
Value-Based Guidance, Precision 
Planning
In the initial stage of 5G network 
construction and during the operation 
phase of in-service networks, operators face 
the important goal of improving network 
utilization and obtaining a timely return
