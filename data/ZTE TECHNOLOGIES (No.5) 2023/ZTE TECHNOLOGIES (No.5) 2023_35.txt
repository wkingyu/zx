Identi/f_ication and Location of User 
Perception Issues
Identifying user perception problems in 
the network in a timely manner is key to 
ensuring user experience. uSmartNet can 
collect the control-plane and user-plane 
data from the wireless, bearer, and core 
networks, and clean, correlate, and integrate 
the data to form a high-quality perception 
database. To solve the increasing problem 
of service identi/f_ication rates for new 
applications, AI capabilities are introduced 
into the probe system at the data collection 
layer. Through machine learning, new 
applications can be identi/f_ied automatically, 
boosting the overall service identi/f_ication 
rate of the system to over 90%. This provides 
a reliable basis for analyzing perception 
problems. 
With the support of complete, reliable, 
and high-quality data, the platform 
quanti/f_ies the user experience for various 
service categories like network browsing, 
video streaming, gaming, OTT video, and 
OTT voice. Using appropriate mathematical 
models, it comprehensively evaluates the 
overall user experience of data services. By 
means of cascading, time sequence, space 
domain, aggregation, and failure reasons, 
the platform demarcates problems with low perception scores to speci/f_ic network 
domains. 
To locate user perception problems more 
quickly and accurately, the platform relies 
on AI capabilities and expert experience 
to continually explore and expand its 
ability to delve deeper into the root causes 
of the problems. On the wireless side, it 
analyzes and locates the root causes of cell 
faults, coverage issues, interference, and 
capacity constraints based on wireless MR, 
CDT, alarms, and performance data, and 
provides corresponding solutions. On the 
bearer side, it locates problems to speci/f_ic 
links based on the delay, jitter, and packet 
loss measurement data of each link, and 
more accurately identi/f_ies and locates 
the problems that aﬀect user perception 
in accordance with the single-domain 
capabilities of radio, bearer, and core 
networks. 
Expertise Combined with uSmartNet's 
Perception Analysis Capability: 
Eﬃciently Resolving User Perception 
Issues
To solve the perception problems that 
aﬀect user experience, such as rate, delay, 
voice quality, and video quality, ZTE has 
developed comprehensive and practical 
functions that facilitate the improvement
