local automatic optimization of controller 
power parameters, global optimization of 
controller power parameters, automatic 
power optimization of the detector, and 
automatic channel power equalization. 
The APO solution implements 
network-wide power equalization by 
overlaying the  power adjustments at 
both the optical multiplexing section 
(OMS) layer and the OCH layer. At the 
OMS layer, when the actual engineering 
parameters (such as /f_iber length) do not 
match the power budget design during 
network commissioning, or when /f_iber 
link attenuation changes during network 
maintenance, APO enables the system 
to automatically adjust the attenuation 
of optical attenuators or the gain of 
ampli/f_iers. This allows the system to 
maintain the intended target power budget 
as designed. At the OCH layer, when 
individual wavelength channels experience 
power /f_luctuations due to factors like /f_iber 
connector losses, APO automatically adjusts 
the attenuation of boards equipped with 
channel attenuation adjustment capabilities 
(such as VMUX). This restores wavelength 
channels with abnormal power levels to 
their optimal operating points. 
During network commissioning, 
APO’s network-wide power setting and 
adjustment capabilities can improve the 
eﬃciency of new network deployment. 
Throughout network operation, APO’s 
real-time intelligent monitoring and 
network-wide power optimization 
capabilities can reduce the manpower costs 
of routine operation and maintenance. 
In addition, APO can rapidly respond to 
network power changes, reducing network 
adjustment time, network degradation 
duration, and even service failure time. This 
signi/f_icantly strengthens network reliability 
and stability, leading to a substantial 
improvement in the intelligence of network 
self-healing capabilities. 
In the scenario of WASON service restoration, APO can automatically 
adjust the optical power of service paths, 
enabling the WASON network to possess 
a genuine automatic global exhaustive 
route computation capability. This greatly 
enhances network robustness. 
Flexible Grids for Self-Intelligence 
Management 
A key concept of a /f_lexible grid is 
frequency slot, which refers to a spectrum 
section that meets the de/f_inition of a 
/f_lexible grid as speci/f_ied in G.694.1. At any 
given moment, this spectrum segment 
can be used for only one optical channel 
and is uniquely de/f_ined by its central 
frequency and slot width. Compared with 
the traditional /f_ixed grid network, a /f_lexible 
grid network has the /f_lexibility to select a 
range of slot widths as required. 
In comparison to the traditional /f_ixed-grid 
network, where all NEs are /f_ixed-grid 
components, and the spectrum resource 
management granularity is based on /f_ixed 
wavelengths, a /f_lexible-grid network oﬀers a 
diﬀerent approach. In a /f_lexible-grid network, 
there's no need for manual grid division in 
the network management. The network 
is composed entirely of fully automated 
/f_lexible-grid NEs. The control plane can 
dynamically create and remove optical-layer 
wave channels as required, without human 
intervention. Resource allocation in a fully 
automated /f_lexible-grid network is based 
on fundamental frequency slots, allowing 
the control plane to eﬃciently allocate 
optical-layer resources within its designated 
spectral range.
In the 100G+ OTN service scenario, 
signals with diﬀerent transmission rates 
or signals with the same transmission 
rate but using diﬀerent modulation 
modes and coding schemes have 
diﬀerent baud rates. This necessitates 
the use of diﬀerent channel spacing. The 
concept of a /f_lexible grid is exceptionally
