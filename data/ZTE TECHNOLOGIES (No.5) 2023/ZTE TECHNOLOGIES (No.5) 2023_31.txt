Fig. 1. Comparison between 
the WASON distributed 
control solution and the 
management and control 
integrated solution.the control plane. The controller provides 
centralized route computation to improve 
the success rate of service restoration. 
The management and control integrated 
solution abstracts the bandwidth supported 
by each board through the network 
management system, eliminating the 
need for manual resource allocation for 
optical-layer boards. The solution also 
deploys collaborative services, enabling 
direct end-to-end cross-layer deployment 
of OAC services. After deployment, it can 
generate optical channels (OCHs) while also 
allowing a one-click removal of services. 
This simpli/f_ies the steps involved in service 
deployment and removal.  
Automated Power Optimization 
for Cost Reduction and Eﬃciency 
Improvement 
The optimization of optical power within 
the optical power system for traditional 
OTNs is carried out manually during joint 
debugging and maintenance phases. This 
is especially challenging in WASON service 
restoration scenarios, where the number 
of routes to be restored can be extensive. Manual operation methods are unable to 
debug all available paths, demanding a 
signi/f_icant amount of human eﬀort. The 
traditional method of prefabricated paths, 
due to its inability to cover all possible 
routes, results in certain risks to network 
robustness. Furthermore, it is unable to 
promptly adjust optical power in the event 
of optical cable degradation, consequently 
aﬀecting services. 
To tackle this challenge, ZTE has 
implemented an automatic power 
optimization (APO) solution. Through 
intelligent algorithms, this solution enables 
automatic control and optimization of optical 
power throughout the entire network. 
Compared with manual calculations and 
interventions, this approach is closer to 
optimal values. This not only enhances 
transmission performance but also reduces 
the need for extra transmission performance 
margins, thereby lowering network 
construction costs. 
The APO solution includes a range of 
functions such as collection and reporting 
of power detector data, target power 
preset for the power detector, power 
parameter setting for the power controller,
