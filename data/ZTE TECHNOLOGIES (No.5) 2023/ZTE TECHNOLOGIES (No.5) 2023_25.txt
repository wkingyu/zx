the BN intelligence tool BigDNA and the 
CN intelligent tool Magiceye, enabling 
automatic demarcation and location 
of bearer and core network problems. 
Furthermore, the interconnection with 
wireless intelligence tool AAX facilitates 
precise locating of wireless-side alarm 
problems and software self-healing, 
ultimately achieving end-to-end automatic 
handling of complaint problems.
In the hidden risk identi/f_ication scenario, 
the industry is still in the early stage of 
exploration, with most network elements 
being handled only after faults occur, 
resulting in /f_luctuations in network quality 
that aﬀect user experience. To address this 
issue, ZTE utilizes its OSS intelligent tool 
AIMIND, which accesses CM/PM/FM data 
from wireless, bearer, and core networks, 
and employs AI algorithms and self-learning 
capabilities to forecast potential site outages. 
According to the forecast results, operators 
can take proactive measures to mitigate 
the risk of site outages, ensuring the stable 
operation of communication networks. 
Moreover, AIMIND provides targeted 
fault predictions in various individual 
domains, including wireless-side optical 
module, RRU/AAU environmental issues, 
voltage-related problems, as well as bearer 
hardware and traﬃc-related faults. Its fault 
prediction capability stands at the forefront 
of the industry.
ZTE’s full-domain autonomous network 
construction solution uSmartNet has 
been implemented in multiple projects. 
Particularly, in the customer complaint 
handling scenario, it has achieved true 
end-to-end automatic network optimization. 
In some scenarios, the solution accomplishes 
automatic closed-loop of problem handling 
without the need for manual intervention. 
This remarkable approach signi/f_icantly 
reduces complaint handling time and 
minimizes the need for expert involvement, 
thereby facilitating operators’ digital 
transformation. Moreover, in the hidden risk identi/f_ication scenario, the solution 
automatically identi/f_ies hidden risks and 
gives suggestions. This capability helps 
operators improve fault handling eﬃciency 
by over 30% and eﬀectively reduces the 
probability of fault occurrence. As a result, 
it enhances network stability and enables 
industry-leading intelligent network O&M, 
empowering operators to stay ahead in the 
market. In addition to achieving automation 
capabilities in the above-mentioned 
scenarios, ZTE has also deployed end-to-end 
solutions for FNR coverage and wireless 
interference issues, expanding the scope of 
operators’ autonomous networks.
Full-domain automation is a vital path 
to the development of communication 
intelligence. Through intelligent technologies, 
it enables cross-domain collaborative 
intelligent network O&M, encompassing 
wireless networks, bearer networks, and 
core networks. This advancement leads 
to improved operational eﬃciency and 
enhances network reliability, security, and 
user experience.
