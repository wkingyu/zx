Extensive 10G PON Deployment
ue to the signi/f_icant 
advantage of /f_iber over 
copper as a transmission 
medium and the decline
in /f_iber optic cable prices, passive optical 
network (PON), characterized by its /f_iber 
infrastructure, passiveness, and P2MP 
topology, has achieved great success over 
the past 15 years. As the transition from 
copper to optical and the acceleration 
of bandwidth continue to deepen, the 
deployment of 10G PON and the upgrade 
from GPON to 10G PON have become 
industry standards. By the end of June 2023, 
global 10G PON shipments had exceeded 30 
million PON ports, with China’s market share 
accounting for approximately 80%. The 
extensive deployment of 10G PON in the 
Chinese market has signi/f_icantly advanced 
the maturity of the 10G PON industry chain 
and reduced costs.
The deployment of 10G PON and the 
provision of gigabit services are mutually 
reinforcing. According to analysis data from 
the consulting /f_irm Omdia, by the end of 
2022, gigabit bandwidth services accounted 
for about 8% of /f_ixed broadband (FBB), and 
this /f_igure is expected to increase to 28% by 
2026. The global deployment of 10G PON 
is accelerating, and it is estimated that by 2026, global 10G PON shipments will surpass 
those of GPON. The next three years are 
expected to be a prime window for 10G PON 
deployment.
Due to variations in population and 
economic development, the timing and 
scale of 10G PON construction may diﬀer 
among regions worldwide. As 10G PON 
deployment gains momentum in North 
America and Europe, it is expected China’s 
market share will gradually decrease, 
while the Asia-Paci/f_ic and South American 
regions are expected to have a competitive 
edge in 10G PON construction.
Five Major Factors Driving Extensive 
10G PON Deployment
New service experience requirements: 
Operators have transitioned their 
construction approach from being 
technology-driven to experience-driven. 
Basic broadband services, particularly 
video services, now account for 
more than 50% of the total traﬃc. 
Platforms like Net/f_lix, YouTube, and 
Tiktok contribute signi/f_icantly to this 
surge in traﬃc. In the post-pandemic 
era, remote work, online education, and 
digital transformation of enterprises and 
industries have greatly driven the demand 
for increased bandwidth.
