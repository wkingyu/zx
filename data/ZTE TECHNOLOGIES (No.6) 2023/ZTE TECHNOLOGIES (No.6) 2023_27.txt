FTTR-B Builds an All-Optical 
Enterprise Network with Upgraded 
Access Bandwidth, User Experience, 
and O&M Capability
Superfast Deployment
The FTTR-B enterprise network features 
a simpli/f_ied two-layer P2MP architecture, 32 
concurrent connections, various installation 
methods, and /f_lexible power supply.
One network to the user side: Fiber 
replaces copper and extends to the 
user side, reducing the overall cabling 
workload.
One network for integrated service 
access:  One optical network provides 
both wired and Wi-Fi access to services 
including data, voice, and video.
One device with multiple functions:  The 
all-in-one FTTR main ONT integrates the 
functions of an access gateway, a router, an 
AC, an IAD, and a PoE switch, simplifying 
device provisioning and deployment.
One-network evolution:  The all-optical 
network can be smoothly upgraded to

for enterprise broadband/Internet private 
lines to an FTTR-B all-optical enterprise 
network, connections are expanded from a 
single point to an entire network (Fig. 2). This 
improvement not only enhances customer 
stickiness, but also leads to a threefold 
increase in ARPU and an 80% reduction in 
network churn rate.
FTTR-B enhances the installation and 
maintenance service connection for 
enterprises, leading to increased revenue 
in the installation and maintenance 
service sector. The operator can provide 
maintenance for the FTTR-B enterprise 
network. This not only enhances customer 
retention but also allows the operator to 
increase revenue by oﬀering value-added 
services. These services include basic 
maintenance services like speed tests, on-site 
engineer visits, and analysis reports, as well 
as advanced maintenance services such as 
quality analysis and network optimization.
FTTR-B enhances the telecom service 
connection for enterprises, increasing 
telecom service revenue. Through the 
combination of network and cloud service, 
it enables one-hop cloud access via 
VxLAN/IPsec. This enhancement facilitates 
the deployment of value-added services
