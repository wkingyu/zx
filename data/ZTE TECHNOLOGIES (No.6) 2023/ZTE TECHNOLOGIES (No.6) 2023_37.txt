a maximum of 576 GE/10GE optical ports 
and 72 100GE optical ports. 
It employs a hardware architecture that 
separates main control from switching. The 
Mesh structure is adopted for connections 
between multiple switching planes and 
line cards, ensuring high performance and 
scalability for the system. 
It also supports the VSC stacking 
technology, so that multiple switches can be 
stacked for high redundancy and scalability. 
Building an Ultra-Stable Network 
Core
ZXR10 C89E features highly reliable 
architecture, high-reliability control, 
high-reliability system, comprehensive 
security protocols, and all-round reliability 
functions, helping to build an ultra-stable 
network core.
Highly reliable architecture:  ZXR10 C89E 
provides redundancy and hot-swappable 
support for critical system components 
such as control boards, switching boards, 
fan modules, and power modules. ZXR10

All-Programmable Chips to Ensure 
Rapid Launch of New Services
ZXR10 C89E utilizes in-house NP chips to 
deliver powerful programmability. When 
protocol evolution and technology updates 
require changes in forwarding processes, 
customers can update software to support 
these changes without hardware replacement. 
This allows services to be launched quickly 
and /f_lexibly, ultimately protecting customer 
investments.
Ultra-Large System Capacity with 
High-Density Ports to Oﬀer High 
Scalability
ZXR10 C89E supports up to 48 wirespeed 
10GE interfaces or six 100GE interfaces per 
slot, making it suitable for campus and data 
center, enabling continuous upgrades and 
capacity expansion. The entire system oﬀers
