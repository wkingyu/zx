large-scale FTTH deployments in regions

according to its own growth plans. 
New Challenges 
Link Net, the second largest /f_ixed-line 
operator in Indonesia, has a /f_ixed broadband 
network with more than 3 million home 
passed, among which 2.4 million belong to 
the hybrid /f_iber-coaxial (HFC) network. During 
the network upgrade and transformation 
process, Link Net has two options to consider: 
one is to upgrade the existing HFC network 
using the Docsis technology, and the other 
is to build an FTTH network using the PON 
technology. After a thorough assessment, 
Link Net prefers PON that utilizes a passive 
optical /f_iber network over Docsis that involves 
active access, as PON has substantial cost 
savings in O&M. Moreover, considering the 
limited global applications and unclear future 
evolution path of the Docsis technology, 
Link Net has made a /f_irm decision to use the Accelerating FTTH Deployment
 
s the global /f_iberization process 
accelerates, FTTH has found 
widespread deployment 
worldwide for its excellent
technical features such as ultra-high 
bandwidth, long-haul transmission, and 
energy eﬃciency, making it a critical access 
technology for /f_ixed broadband networks. 
However, due to Indonesia’s extensive island 
geography, the cost of FTTH construction 
remains high, resulting in a relatively low 
maturity in /f_ixed broadband infrastructure 
with a penetration rate of only 17%. To 
improve national broadband accessibility and 
boost digital growth, the Indonesian Ministry 
of Communication has outlined strategic 
broadband network development goals 
for the 2020–2024 period. This plan aims 
to increase the country’s /f_ixed broadband 
penetration rate to 30%, necessitating the 
construction of approximately 28 million lines 
of FTTH networks. As a leader in Indonesia’s 
/f_ixed-line market, Link Net actively responds ADEC 2023
