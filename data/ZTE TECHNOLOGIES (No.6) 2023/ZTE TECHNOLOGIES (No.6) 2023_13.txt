various industries, the adoption of 
passive optical network (PON) in place 
of traditional Ethernet has become an 
industry consensus. FTTx deployment 
is extending from home settings to 
corporate campuses, empowering a 
multitude of industries.
Low-cost evolution:  In the post-pandemic 
era, there is a growing emphasis 
among operators on cost control. This 
necessitates network equipment to 
possess extended deployment and 
adaptability capabilities, including 
backward compatibility and forward 
scalability, to prolong the in-service 
lifespan of the devices.
Finalized 50G PON standard:  With 
Recommendation G.9804.3 released in 
2021 and G.9804.3 Amendment 1 issued 
in 2023, the 50G PON standard has been /f_inalized. 50G PON is expected to  see a 
commercial deployment in 2025.
With a profound understanding of 
the development trends in FBB, ZTE 
launched the new-generation Tbps-level 
all-optical access platform, ZXA10 C600E, 
at the Network X 2023 trade show. On 
one hand, this platform is compatible 
with the service cards of the  massively 
deployed ZXA10 C600 (Fig. 1), allowing 
for /f_lexible card intermixing and smooth 
evolution during network upgrades and 
service deployments. On the other hand, its 
bandwidth capacity meets the requirements 
for large-scale deployment of 50G PON. 
The platform enables deterministic 
networking and provides open capabilities 
to gain enhanced adaptability. Moreover, 
it adopts energy-eï¬ƒcient technologies
