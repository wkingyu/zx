network management system (NMS), 
digitally presents the optical link topology 
of the entire network. This process enables 
real-time collection and synchronization of 
ODN resources and make the optical link 
topology visible and manageable, with 
resource accuracy reaching 100%.
The visual management of the ODN 
encompasses the physical /f_iber network, 
the digital network, and intelligent 
management:
Physical /f_iber network: Pre-
connectorized boxes with QR codes and 
pre-connectorized optical cables with 
barcodes are used to build the physical 
optical network. The pre-connectorized 
connections outside the boxes and the 
point-to-point single-core connections 
of the cables make it easy to collect the 
optical link information.
Digital network:  The mobile app is used 
to scan and identify the connections of 
ODN materials such as boxes and optical 
cables based on image recognition 
technology. The results generated are 
transmitted in real time to the NMS, 
where they are electronically recorded 
and managed as the basic data of 
network topology. Based on the acquired information, the NMS presents a digital 
network topology that perfectly matches 
the physical /f_iber network.
Intelligent management:  With the 
accurate data from the digital network, 
optical link resources can be visualized 
on the NMS. A geographic information 
system (GIS) is employed to display 
the resource information on a map, 
thereby providing visual guidance for 
O&M. Additionally, optical link resource 
usage is intelligently analyzed to inform 
resource optimization strategies that 
guide network O&M and expansion to 
save time and reduce OPEX.
Eï¬ƒcient O&M:  When users report faults, 
automatic testing and diagnosis of 
faults are initiated for the point to multi 
point (P2MP) network. Faults of the 
/f_iber lines, such as breaks, bends, and 
connector contamination, are identi/f_ied 
and  accurately located. Based on the 
test and diagnosis results, maintenance 
personnel can perform troubleshooting 
quickly and easily.
ZTE's Light ODN solution can clearly 
present the following resource data on the 
logical view page of the NMS (Fig. 1):
