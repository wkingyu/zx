n the post-pandemic era, broadband 
network  development is gaining 
renewed momentum. Speci/f_ically, the 
development of broadband 
access has /f_ive characteristics:
Dominance of video services in 
broadband network traﬃc:  Video 
services have garnered favor among 
a vast user base through their /f_lexible 
presentation, robust interactivity, and 
real-time accessibility. The widespread 
popularity of platforms such as Net/f_lix, 
YouTube, and TikTok is further propelling 
the growth of video services. In addition, 
video is developing into fragmented and 
short-form content. According to reports 
from consulting /f_irms, video services 
now account for over 50% of global 
broadband traﬃc, aﬃrming the adage 
that “video is king.” 
Increased demand for symmetrical 
bandwidth:  The emergence of 
applications like remote work, 
interactive community, online 
education, online gaming, and 
live-streamed shopping has spurred a 
heightened demand for symmetrical 
bandwidth. This marks a departure  from the traditional traﬃc model, where 
downstream bandwidth far exceeded 
upstream bandwidth, and poses new 
requirements for enhancing end-to-end 
network bandwidth.
Accelerated digital transformation: 
In the realm of home connectivity, 
there is a gradual shift away from 
aging twisted-pair and coaxial cable 
infrastructure towards /f_iber-optic 
solutions. While /f_iber to the home 
(FTTH) deployment is still in progress, 
/f_iber to the room (FTTR) has emerged 
as a new trend and a transition to an 
all-optical home network is becoming 
the prevailing direction. By the end of 
2022, /f_iber to the anything (FTTx) users 
had accounted for more than 65% of 
/f_ixed broadband (FBB) subscribers. In 
the realm of corporate campuses and
