while both the service provisioning and 
the cutover get easy. The solution is 
applicable to a variety of scenarios, such 
as the broadband network upgrade and 
reconstruction, green/f_ield, and MSOs’ 
optical /f_iber transformation. It is a highly 
applicable cost-eﬀective solution that allows 
for continuous bandwidth upgrade and 
evolution of FTTx network. 
Conclusion
 
As a technology leader in the optical access 
/f_ield, ZTE has achieved several signi/f_icant 
milestones in the development of 50G PON 
technology. In 2022, ZTE launched the world's 
/f_irst precise 50G PON prototype at MWC 
2022 and the world's /f_irst 50G PON+Wi-Fi 7 
ONU prototype at the FTTH Conference. In 
2023, ZTE introduced its three-mode Combo 
PON solution at MWC 2023 and its/uni00A0 Tbit-level/uni00A0
all-optical access platform, ZXA10 C600E 
designed for the large-scale deployment 
of 50G PON networks at the Network X 
exhibition. 
Leveraging its extensive experience in 
the development of FTTx and profound 
understanding of the future development 
direction of PON technologies, ZTE will continue 
to drive innovation in 50G PON technology, 
expand the 50G PON all-optical foundation, and 
accelerate the advancement of the 50G PON 
industry chain.

wavelength stacking mechanism, supports 
GPON, 10G PON and 50G PON, shares the 
same ODN and platform, and solves the 
problems of high construction costs, large 
footprint, complex optical /f_iber cabling, 
and diﬃcult operation and maintenance 
during the evolution from GPON to 10G 
PON and then to 50G PON. This solution 
helps operators quickly and /f_lexibly 
provision high-bandwidth services, 
simpli/f_ies network construction, and saves 
deployment costs.
In the network upgrade process, the 
three-mode Combo PON solution does 
not need to adjust the ODN or change 
the existing OLT con/f_igurations and user 
service data during network upgrade, 
facilitating /f_lexible deployment and 
smooth network evolution. Meanwhile, the 
solution integrates the 50G PON, 10G PON, 
GPON, and optical multiplexer functions 
into the same optical module without 
requiring extra equipment or additional 
equipment room space, which greatly 
saves the types of line cards and simpli/f_ies 
maintenance and management. 
In addition, the solution uses the 
wavelength division mode, automatically 
matches the 50G PON channel, 10G PON 
channel, and GPON channel with diﬀerent 
types of ONUs, and inherits the existing 
OSS provisioning process. The service 
provisioning /f_low remains unchanged
