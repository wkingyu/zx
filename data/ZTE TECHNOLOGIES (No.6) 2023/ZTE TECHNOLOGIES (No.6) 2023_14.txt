50G PON deployment 
 
and GPON Combo solution. GPON, 10G 
PON, and 50G PON optical network units 
(ONUs) can be connected on demand 
and coexist within the same optical 
distribution network (ODN), without 
the need to modify existing optical line 
terminals (OLTs) and ODN. 50G PON 
devices are highly compatible with the 
in-service ONUs, minimizing the cost of 
network upgrades.
Deterministic bandwidth and 
latency:  To meet the requirements 
for deterministic bandwidth, low 
latency, and low jitter in certain 
industrial scenarios and campus 
environments, ZXA10 C600E employs 
hard pipes to guarantee the necessary 
bandwidth and low latency for 
services. For instance, through the use 
of single-frame multi-burst technology 
to trade bandwidth for time, the 
latency can be reduced by up to 75%. 
The hard pipe technology is employed 
to create hard slices for downstream 
PON traﬃc. By adopting a hard pipe 
scheme, the original scheme of 
statistical multiplexing for downstream 
PON traﬃc is optimized to ensure the 
performance. The dynamic bandwidth 
allocation (DBA) on the PON ports is 
 
to build a sustainable green network.
ZXA10 C600E has the following features:
Compatibility with the service cards 
of ZXA10 C600:  To ensure smooth 
network evolution and seamless 
platform switchover, ZXA10 C600E 
is forward-compatible with service 
cards of ZXA10 C600, including GPON, 
10-Gigabit-capable symmetric passive 
optical network (XG (S)-PON), Any-PON, 
Combo PON, 50G PON Combo, 
point-to-point (PtP), and Ethernet 
uplink cards. This facilitates hybrid 
networking of ZXA10 C600E and ZXA10 
C600, allowing for the intermixing of 
service cards. As a result, operators can 
minimize the expenses associated with 
network upgrades.
Tbps-level per-slot bandwidth 
capability to meet the requirements 
for large-scale 50G PON deployment:  
Employing the Combo PON concept to 
implement the evolution from GPON 
to 10G PON and further to 50G PON is 
a cost-eﬀective solution that requires 
minimal changes to the existing 
network. Tbps-level bandwidth meets 
the requirements for large-scale 
deployment of the 50G PON, 10G PON Turbocharging FTTx Network Special Topic
