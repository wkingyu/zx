igital transformation is 
accelerating across numerous 
industries, and there is a 
growing trend towards building 
robust data networks. The rapid adoption 
of cloud computing, big data, and Internet 
of things (IoT) is fueling an explosive growth 
in data traﬃc. The traditional traﬃc models 
are evolving in both operator networks 
and enterprise campuses. As southbound 
and northbound traﬃc steadily rises, 
eastbound and westbound traﬃc is also 
soaring as a major traﬃc mode. The existing 
10GE network architecture is inadequate 
to accommodate these traﬃc changes, 
making 100GE and multi-100GE network 
convergence the mainstream choices. 
Core/aggregation switches play an 
increasingly important role in the network. 
They are responsible for connecting a large 
number of access-layer devices, handling 
the convergence of northbound and 
southbound user traﬃc, and exchanging 
a great deal of eastbound and westbound 
traﬃc. This presents unprecedented 
challenges for device performance. 
Scalability, reliability, and security are also 
key indicators that users consider when 
evaluating aggregation-layer devices. 
ZXR10 C89E is a /f_lagship high-end

 (DC), or metropolian area network (MAN) 
aggregation switch in scenarios such as 
telecommunications networks, campus 
networks, medical networks, government 
networks, energy networks, and /f_inancial 
networks. This switch is designed to build 
a 100GE-class ultra-high-bandwidth data 
network for customers.
The ZXR10 C89E series switch adopts a 
large-capacity, fully distributed modular 
design and oﬀers high-density full-wirespeed 
solutions for GE, 10GE, and 100GE ports, 
catering to the demands of multi-layer 
link bandwidth. It delivers comprehensive 
support for perfect QoS, all-round security 
protection, and multi-service transport, 
enabling users to construct an eﬃcient, 
intelligent, and reliable network. The series 
consists of three types of products: ZXR10 
C89E-4, ZXR10 C89E-8, and ZXR10 C89E-12, 
each with varying capacity. For speci/f_ic 
details, please refer to Table 1. 
CLOS Architecture to Signi/f_icantly 
Increase Forwarding Eﬃciency
ZXR10 C89E employs a CLOS architecture 
that incorporates in-house non-blocking 
switching chips, a distributed switching 
design, and multiple switching planes to 
maximize data forwarding eﬃciency. It 
utilizes a cell switching mechanism to split 
a data packet into multiple equal-length cells,
