ing the x .265 encoder to generate high -quality videos . To in ⁃
vestigate whether the QP can influence the impact of framer ⁃
ates on the perceptual video quality , V5 and V 6 were encoded 
with four different QPs , i.e., 22, 32, 36, and 39, to generate 
four quality levels . During the experiment , video sequences 
were displayed in their resolution in random orders . It is noted 
that videos with 120 fps were displayed at 90 fps on the HMD 
since the refresh rate of the HMD is only 90 Hz.
3.2.3 Experiment 2: Obtaining Visual Realism
Three high -quality stereoscopic videos (3 840×3 840 resolu ⁃
tion) were downloaded . Note that the audio tracks were not 
used in this experiment . These videos last for 20 s and have a 
frame rate of 30 fps. The projection mode is equirectangular . 
They were firstly separated into two monoscopic videos , namely 
the left and right videos , separately . To investigate the impact 
of stereoscopic vision , the left videos and stereoscopic videos 
were utilized as the test materials that were further encoded 
into three quality levels : 1 Mbit/s , 5 Mbit/s and 14 Mbit/s  for 
monoscopic videos and 2 Mbit/s , 8 Mbit/s and 18 Mbit/s for 
stereoscopic videos . The FOV was set to be 60 degrees , 90 de⁃
grees and 110 degrees , respectively . The ACR 5-point scale 
was also used in this experiment to record the evaluation 
scores for the perceptual video quality and visual realism . To 
obtain visual realism , the subjects were asked a question : “To 
what extent are your visual experiences in the virtual environ ⁃
ment consistent with that in the real world ?”.
3.2.4 Experiment 3: Obtaining Perceptual Audio Quality
The audio tracks from the perceptual evaluation of audio 
quality (PEAQ ) conformance test listed in ITU -R BS .1387[42] 
were employed as the reference . More specifically , six 
samples , four music pieces and two speeches , were used , as 
summarized in Table 2. The sampling frequency of all audio 
files is 48 kHz . Stereo (two -channel ) audio files were used for 
the test . They were encoded using the Advanced Audio Codec 
(AAC ) encoder with a bit rate of 8 kbit/s , 16 kbit/s , 32 kbit/s , 
64 kbit/s , 128 kbit/s , 256 kbit/s , and 320 kbit/s , respectively 
and a sampling rate of 48 kHz . The generated audio se ⁃
quences were displayed to subjects on a high -fidelity head ⁃
phone in a random order . After each display , the subjects 
were asked to rate the quality levels of audio files in ACR 5-
point scales .
3.2.5 Experiment 4: Obtaining Acoustic Realism
The left videos in Experiment 2 encoded with 14 Mbit/s and 
corresponding audio files were used in this experiment to in ⁃vestigate the influence of the audio quality and spatial audio 
on acoustic realism . The audio component of these videos was 
in eight channels with each representing the sound from one 
direction . The original audio files were encoded using the 
AAC codec with a bit rate of 128 kbit/s and a sampling rate 
of 44.1 kHz . The sound from front -left and front -right was 
firstly mixed into the stereo audio . Then , the stereo audio 
files and original spatial audio files were encoded with 16 
kbit/s , 32 kbit/s , 64 kbit/s , and 128 kbit/s to generate four 
quality levels . After the display of each audiovisual se ⁃
quence , two questions were asked : “How do you rate the qual ⁃
ity of the audio you just heard ?” and “To what extent are your 
acoustic experiences in the virtual environment consistent 
with that in the real world ?”. Then , the subjects used the 
ACR 5-point scale to score the audio quality and acoustic re ⁃
alism of the test sequences separately .
3.2.6 Experiment 5: Obtaining Proprioceptive Matching
In this experiment , the influence of the MTP latency and AL 
on proprioceptive matching was investigated . First , three left vi ⁃
sion videos in Experiment 2 with “excellent ” video quality 
were displayed with seven lengths of MTP latency , i.e., 0 ms, 
20 ms, 60 ms, 100 ms, 200 ms, 300 ms, and 500 ms, in a ran ⁃
dom order . Their audio files (high quality , 128 kbit/s ) were dis ⁃
played with no audio latency . Then , these videos were dis ⁃
played with no MTP latency while the corresponding spatial 
audio files (high quality , 128 kbit/s ) were displayed with eight 
different lengths of audio latency , i.e., 0 ms, 20 ms, 60 ms, 
150 ms, 300 ms, 500 ms, 1 000 ms, and 2 000 ms, respec ⁃
tively . The subjects were asked to score the degree of proprio ⁃
ceptive matching for the test sequences with the ACR 5-
point scale .
3.2.7 Experiment 6: Obtaining Spatial Presence
As listed in Table 3, the original stereoscopic videos (i.e., 
denoted as S 1 to S 3) and corresponding stereo audio files in 
Experiment 2 were first encoded and displayed on the HMD 
with no MTP latency and AL . Then , the original audiovisual 
files were encoded with high quality and displayed with six 
MTP latencies , i.e., 0 ms, 20 ms, 80 ms, 150 ms, 300 ms, and
