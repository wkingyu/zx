output AC and the FC voltage . The DC bus voltage is 375 V 
and the load is 120 Ω. In this case , the output voltage is stan ⁃
dard five levels , each level of which is Vdc/4, and the flying ca ⁃
pacitor voltage is stable at Vdc/4. The output current has low 
harmonic content .
As shown in Fig . 8, the rectifier capability is verified . The in ⁃put voltage is 220 Vac , the peak input current is 10 A, the out ⁃
put voltage is 400 Vdc, and the FC voltage is 100 V. Fig. 8(a) 
shows that the voltage ripple across the FC is 12 V and the cur ⁃
rent ripple is about 1 A. As shown in Fig . 8(b), after adopting 
the FC voltage balance control , the FC voltage can basically 
maintain balanced near the reference value . The voltage ripple 
is 6 V and the current ripple is about 0.4 A. It can be seen that 
the level stability is improved , and THD is reduced from 6.72% 
to 4.27%, which verifies the effectiveness of the flying capacitor 
control strategy .
Fig. 9 shows the waveform of dual control loops rectifier 
condition , including input current io, terminal voltage Vn, out⁃
put voltage Vdc, and input voltage Vac. The input is 220 VAC 
and the load is 150 Ω. It can be seen that the combination of 
two bridge arms produces seven voltage levels . The second -
