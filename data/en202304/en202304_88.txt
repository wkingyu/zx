Abstract : This paper proposes a design and fine -tuning method for mixed electric and magnetic coupling filters . It derives the quantitative re ⁃
lationship between the coupling coefficients (electric and magnetic coupling , i.e., EC and MC) and the linear coefficients of frequency -
dependent coupling for the first time . Different from the parameter extraction technique using the bandpass circuit model , the proposed ap ⁃
proach explicitly relatesEC and MC to the coupling matrix model . This paper provides a general theoretic framework for computer -aided design 
and tuning of a mixed electric and magnetic coupling filter based on coupling matrices . An example of a 7th-order coaxial combline filter de ⁃
sign is given in the paper , verifying the practical value of the approach .

1 Introduction
In the design of microwave filters , the realization of finite 
transmission zeros (TZs) is critical to improving selectiv ⁃
ity. Cross -coupling is the most popular method to create 
TZs[1]. However , this multi -path mechanism often leads to 
complexity in the design of filter layout , especially for high -
order filters with many TZs . To solve this problem , frequency -
dependent coupling (FDC) is introduced into the filter design . 
In an FDC , the coupling coefficient will be zero at a specific 
frequency , creating extra TZs in a given filter network .
SZYDLOWSKI et al .[2–5] proposed an optimization -based 
approach to the synthesis of coupling matrices with FDCs . 
Years later , HE[6–7] and ZHAO[8] developed deterministic ma ⁃
trix transformation approaches that can eliminate one cross -
coupling from traditional N-tuples and introduce FDCs into 
the network . Constant couplings can be realized as pure elec ⁃
tric or magnetic coupling , whereas FDCs need to be imple ⁃
mented as mixed electric and magnetic couplings . However , 
the mixed electric and magnetic coupling is difficult to con ⁃
trol, because there is no quantitative relationship between 
FDCs and the mixed electric and magnetic couplings .
In 2006 , MA[9] proposed constructing an electrical coupling and a magnetic coupling path between two resonators to gener ⁃
ate a TZ . However , he did not give the relationship between 
the TZ position and the electric and magnetic coupling coeffi ⁃
cients . In 2008 , CHU[10–11] defined the mixed electric and 
magnetic coupling coefficient and gave the extraction method 
of the electric coupling coefficient (EC) and the magnetic cou ⁃
pling coefficient (MC) from the electromagnetic (EM) simula ⁃
tion of mixed electric and magnetic coupling structures . Fur⁃
thermore , the relationship between the location of TZ and (EC, 
MC) is found . However , the parameter extraction is carried out 
in the bandpass domain . The approach does not explicitly re ⁃
late Ec and Mc to the coupling matrix model , which is popular 
in filter synthesis . Therefore , it is difficult to design or tune 
the mixed coupling by coupling matrix extraction approaches .
This paper derives the explicit relationship between EC (MC) 
in the mixed electric and magnetic coupling and elements in 
the coupling and capacitance matrices . With the coupling ma ⁃
trix extracted by the model -based vector fitting (MVF ) tech ⁃
nique[12], the filter designer can easily design and tune the 
mixed coupling filter by comparing the extracted matrices 
with target ones .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 de⁃
rives the relationship between the lowpass FDC model and the 
bandpass mixed coupling coefficients (EC and MC). Section 3 
presents a mixed electric and magnetic coupling physical
