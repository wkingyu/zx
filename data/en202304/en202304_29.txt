the -art algorithms , so as to meet the requirements of point 
cloud geometry lossless compression in multimedia applica ⁃
tion scenarios such as dynamic portraits .
4.4 Ablation Study
We perform ablation studies on predictive encoding over 8i 
voxelized full -body point cloud data sequences to demonstrate 
the effectiveness of the partition . It can be seen from Table 5 
that the improvement shows a stable gain of −70% on multi -
frame point cloud compression and −60% on single -frame 
point cloud compression against the non -partition predictive 
coding .
Next , we perform an ablation experiment on arithmetic 
coding to demonstrate the effectiveness of the context dic ⁃
tionary . As shown in Table 6, a robust improvement of 
−33% on multi -frame point cloud compression and that of 
−41% on single -frame point cloud compression against the 
arithmetic coding without context dictionary are observed in our method .
4.5 Time Consumption
We test the time consumption to evaluate the algorithm 
complexity and compare the proposed methods with others . 
The algorithm complexity is analyzed by encoders and decod ⁃
ers independently , listed in Table 7. As we can see , G-PCC, 
interEM and PCL -PCC can achieve an encoding time of less 
than 10 s and a decoding time of less than 5 s for portrait 
dense point cloud data . They also perform well in large -scale 
sparse point cloud data compared with others . Our proposed 
algorithms take around 60 s and 15 s to encode and decode 
portrait sequences , even more on facade and architecture 
point cloud data . There is a trade -off between bitrates and 
compression speed . Compared with S 3D and S 4D, which take 
hundreds of seconds to encode , our time -consuming method 
can show superiority .
In summary , the time consumption of our proposed methods 
is medium among all the compared algorithms but still neces ⁃
sary to be further improved .
5 Conclusions
In this paper , we propose a spatio -temporal context -
guided method for lossless point cloud geometry compres ⁃
sion. We consider sliced point cloud of unit thickness as the 
input unit and adopt the geometry predictive coding mode 
based on the travelling salesman algorithm , which applies to 
both intra -frame and inter -frame . Moreover , we make full 
use of the global context information and adaptive arithme ⁃
tic encoder based on context fast update to achieve lossless 
compression and decompression results of point clouds . Ex⁃
perimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our meth ⁃
ods and their superiority over previous studies . For future 
work , we plan to further study the overall complexity of the 
algorithm , by reducing algorithm complexity to achieve a 
high -speed compression rate and low bit rate compression 
results . A low bit rate and real -time/low -delay supported 
method is highly desired in various types of scenes .▼Table 5. Ablation study on predictive encoding
