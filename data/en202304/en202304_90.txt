In the above derivation , we use the narrowband condition of 
ω0 >> BW . This condition also applies to the derivation of 
Eqs. (7), (9) and (10). ωm is the resonant frequency . When the 
frequency is  ωm, the parallel Cm', Lm' and bm' form an open cir ⁃
cuit, and the signal transmission is blocked to generate a TZ .
For a mixed electric and magnetic coupling , the calculation 
formula of Ec and Mc can be expressed as follows[10]:
EC=ωev2-ωod2
ωev2+ωod2-2ωm2, (5a)
MC=ωm2( ) ωev2-ωod2
2ωev2ωod2-ωm2( ) ωev2+ωod22
, (5b)
where ωev is the even mode resonant frequency , and ωod is the 
odd mode resonant frequency of a coupled resonator pair .
We can calculate EC and MC in the mixed electric and 
magnetic coupling based on ωm, ωev, and ωod. To obtain EC 
and MC of the mixed electric and magnetic coupling in terms 
of FDC coefficients , we can analyze the even - and odd -mode 
resonant frequencies of the coupled -resonator circuit model 
in Fig . 1(c).
We analyze the odd mode first . The odd -mode sub -circuit is 
shown in Fig . 2(a). After combining parallel -connected capaci ⁃
tors, inductors , and FISs , the odd -mode sub -circuit is trans ⁃
formed into the form shown in Fig . 2(b). We have :Codd=C1'-2Cm'=1-Cm
2πBW    , (6a)
Lodd=2C1'Cm'
C1'+2Cm'=2πBW

Therefore , the resonant frequency of the odd mode is
ωod=b2

Similarly , to analyze the even mode , as shown in Fig . 2(c), we 
have
Ceven=1+Cm
2πBW , (8a)
Leven=2πBW

0() 1+Cm, (8b)
beven=bm. (8c)
Therefore , the resonant frequency of the even mode sub -
circuit is
ωeven=b2
even+4Ceven
Leven-beven
2Ceven≈
ω0-bmπBW
1+Cm.(9)
Substituting Eqs . (7) and (9) into Eq . (5) yields
EC=ωev2-ωod2
ωev2+ωod2-2ωm2≈-Cm, (10a)
MC=ωm2( ) ωev2-ωod2
2ωev2ωod2-ωm2( ) ωev2+ωod22≈-Cm
 . (10b)
The results in Eq . (10) show that EC and MC in mixed elec ⁃
tric and magnetic coupling filters are almost equal , and both 
values are approximately equal to −Cm. This analysis result re ⁃
veals that the majority of electric and magnetic coupling 
should be canceled with each other to realize an FDC . The
