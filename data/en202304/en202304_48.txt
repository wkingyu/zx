December  2023  Vol.21 No.4WANG Chongchong , LI Yao , WANG Beibei , CAO Hong , ZHANG Yanyong Point Cloud Processing Methods for 3D Point Cloud Detection Tasks    Special Topic
is the basic network model , which is used to process the point 
cloud data and extract features . Different network models have 
different advantages and disadvantages for point cloud pro ⁃
cessing . For example , GNN can capture the structure and rela ⁃
tionship of point cloud data by using nodes and edges . It can 
handle irregular and unordered data better than convolutional 
neural networks .
5 Conclusions
In this paper , we summarize the processing of point clouds 
in object detection . Point cloud processing is the first step in 
most models and it can greatly affect the performance of subse ⁃
quent detection operations . Point cloud processing can be di ⁃
vided into two categories : voxel -based and point -based pro ⁃
cessing , both of which have their own advantages and disad ⁃
vantages .
Voxel -based processing is a method that divides the three -
dimensional space into small cubes called voxels and assigns 
points to voxels according to their coordinates . The advantage 
of voxel -based processing is that it can convert point clouds 
into ordered data and reduce computational complexity . How ⁃
ever, voxel -based processing may introduce quantization er ⁃
rors and lose some fine -grained details . Many works have im ⁃
proved voxel -based methods by changing the way voxels are 
divided , changing the network for processing voxels , changing 
the data structure for processing data , etc. These approaches 
can reduce time complexity and organize voxel -level features 
well, further improving performance .
Point -based processing is a method that directly operates 
on raw points without any transformation or quantization . The 
advantage of point -based processing is that it can preserve the 
original structure and information of point clouds . However , 
point -based processing may face challenges such as irregular ⁃
ity and sparsity of point clouds . Many works have improved 
point -based methods by improving the way of point cloud sam ⁃
pling , introducing some voxel -based features or directly ob ⁃
taining the graph structure from the structure of the original 
point cloud data . These approaches can enhance the feature 
extraction and representation of points , which can also signifi ⁃
cantly improve the performance of subsequent detection .
