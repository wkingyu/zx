16 males and 14 females aged between 22 and 33 years . All of 
them have normal or corrected -to-normal sight . The experi ⁃
ments were conducted in the test environment following ITU -T 
P.913[38]. A flagship HMD , i.e., HTC VIVE Pro , was employed 
as the display device , which has a screen with an original reso ⁃
lution of 2 880×1 600 pixels , a refresh rate of 90 Hz, and a 
horizontal FOV of 110 degrees . Moreover , a 360 -degree video 
player with the Equirectangular projection was developed to 
display the videos on the HMD . The display FOV , length of 
the MTP latency , and audio latency can be set as desired . Our 
study adopted a single -stimuli scoring strategy[38].
3.2.2 Experiment 1: Obtaining Perceptual Video Quality
In this experiment , ten YUV 420 original videos were em ⁃
ployed to form a video database , including four 360 -degree 
videos (i.e., denoted as O 1 to O 4) proposed by Joint Video Ex ⁃
ploration Team (JVET ) of ITU -T VCEG and ISO/IEC 
MPEG[39–40] and six 2D videos (i.e., denoted as V 1 to V 6) pro⁃
vided by the Ultra Video Group[41], as shown in Fig . 2. The 
360 -degree videos have a spatial resolution of 3 840×1 920 
pixels , a framerate of 30 fps and a length of 10 s. The 2D vid ⁃
eos have a spatial resolution of 3 840×2 160 pixels , a framer ⁃
ate of 120 fps and a length of 5 s. The experiment was divided 
into 2 sub -experiments , which were designed to investigate 
the impact of bitrate and frame rate on the perceptual video 
quality . Details of the experiment settings are introduced as 
follows :
1) Investigating the impact of video bitrate
Four 360 -degree videos , i.e., O1 to O 4, were utilized to in ⁃
vestigate the relationship between the video bitrate and the 
perceptual video quality . The bits per pixel (BPP) were em ⁃
ployed to unify the coding bitrates under different resolutions . 
It can be calculated by
BPP=Br
RH×RV×f , (1)
where Br and f are the video bitrate and frame rate , respec ⁃tively . RH and RV are the horizontal and vertical source resolu ⁃
tions . The original 360 -degree videos were down -sampled and 
encoded using an x 265 encoder according to the settings 
listed in Table 1.
During the experiment , video sequences were displayed in 
random orders using the HMD . Subjects can change their 
viewport by rotating their head . There was a 10-second inter ⁃
val between each two video sequences . Subjects could rate the 
perceptual video quality using the Absolute Category Rating 
(ACR ) 5-point scale (corresponding to the perceived quality of 
“excellent ,” “good,” “fair,” “poor,” and “bad” from 5 to 1 
point ) during the 10-second interval . Before the formal test , 
the subjects were asked to rate a few example videos to get fa ⁃
miliar with the scoring scale and the scoring tool .
2) Investigating the impact of frame rate
To the best of our knowledge , there is no 360 -degree video 
database containing videos with a frame rate higher than 60 
fps. As the screen refresh rate of the current HMDs can reach 
90 Hz, we have to use six 2D videos with a high frame rate , i.e., 
V1 to V 6, to study the impact of frame rate . Each original video 
was repeated twice to generate a video of 10 s. Then , they were 
down -sampled to 60 fps, 30 fps, and 15 fps. These videos (in⁃
cluding the original 120 fps) were further spatially down -
sampled to 960 × 540. Videos generated from V 1 to V 4 were 
encoded with a fixed quantization parameter (QP), i.e., 22, us⁃
