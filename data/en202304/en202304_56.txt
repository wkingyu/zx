December  2023  Vol.21 No.4YIN Yujie , CHEN Zhang Perceptual Optimization for Point -Based Point Cloud Rendering    Special Topic
4 Conclusions
In this paper , we focus on optimizing the perceptual quality 
of point cloud rendering through outlier detection . We evalu ⁃
ate the performance of the proposed method in terms of per ⁃
ceptual quality and the PSNR improvement ratio . In addition , 
we evaluate time complexity analysis and perform ablation 
studies . Future work may include applying other methods to 
outlier detection in rendering to improve the perceptual qual ⁃
ity after point cloud rendering .
