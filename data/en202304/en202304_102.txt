videos . A one -way analysis of variance (ANOVA ) test indi ⁃
cates that there is no significant effect of the type of vision on 
visual realism . Based on the results above , the video quality 
and FOV appear to have a more significant impact on visual 
realism than the type of vision . Thus , the relationship of per ⁃
ceptual video quality , FOV , and visual realism can be calcu ⁃
lated by
VRE(PVQ, FOV)=max(min(v8PVQ+v9FoV+v10, 5), 1),
(8)
where v8, v9 and v10 are equal to 0.595, 0.02 and −0.735, re⁃
spectively .
4.3 Perceptual Audio Quality and Acoustic Realism As ⁃
sessment
We first model the perceptual audio quality using the ex ⁃
perimental results of Experiment 3. Fig. 9 shows the logarith ⁃
mic relationship between the audio bitrate and the perceptual 
audio quality . This relationship can be represented as
PAQ(ABr)=1+v11-v11
1+()ABr
v12v13
, (9)
where v11, v12 and v13 are equal to 4.103, 42.36 and 1.251, re⁃
spectively .
As for AR , Fig. 10 shows the relationship between the per ⁃
ceptual audio quality and acoustic realism . It can be found 
that there is a significant linear relationship between the audio 
quality and acoustic realism for stereo audio (R2 = 0.881, F = 
213.251, and p = 0.000 < 0.05) and for spatial audio (R2 = 
0.955, F = 73.791, and p = 0.000 < 0.05). The relationship in 
Fig.10 can be expressed asAR(PAQ)=v14PAQ+v15, (10)
where v14 and v15 are equal to 0.733 and 0.634 for the stereo 
audio , and equal to 0.682 and 1.167 for the spatial audio .
4.4 Proprioceptive Matching Assessment
Fig. 11 shows the relationship between the two types of de ⁃
lay and proprioceptive matching . It can be seen that the pro ⁃
prioceptive matching decreases with the increase of both the 
MTP latency and AL . Here , the degradations of proprioceptive 
matching caused by the MTP latency and AL are calculated by
DMOS(MTP)=5-MOS(MTP), (11)
DMOS(AL)=5-MOS(AL). (12)
Fig. 12 shows the relationship between the two types of de ⁃
lay and the degradation of proprioceptive matching . This rela ⁃
