be further categorized into two main groups : model -based 
methods[4, 23, 26–28, 42, 47–64] and projection -based meth ⁃
ods[6, 10–11, 18, 25, 36, 65–67].
3.1 Model -Based Methods
In the early stage of research on objective point cloud qual ⁃
ity assessment , most of the research started from the perspec ⁃
tive of the 3D model of the point cloud . Fig. 3 illustrates the 
general framework of the model -based methods . Specifically , 
methods such as p 2point[68], p2plane[47, 49] p2mesh[69] and 
plane 2plane[23] give quality scores by calculating the distance 
between discrete points as a similarity metric . Differently , 
p2point[68] uses the Euclidean distance between points as a 
similarity measure , p2plane[47, 49] calculates the projection er ⁃
ror of related points along the discovery direction , while 
plane 2plane[23] evaluates the quality of point clouds through 
the angle similarity of the tangent plane . Later , JAVAHERIE 
et al . introduced more distance measures into objective 
PCQA , including Peak -Signal -to-Noise Ratio (PSNR )[27], Gen ⁃
eralized Hausdorff Distance[51] and Mahalanobis Distance[54], 
to effectively measure the correspondence between points and 
distributions . MEYNET et al .[50] extended the Mesh Structural 
Distortion Measure (MSDM )[86–87] metric method in Mesh to 
the point cloud field , and designed PC -MSDM based on local 
curvature statistics . However , these works still stay in the mea ⁃
surement of geometric features of point clouds and ignore the ▼Table 3. Summary of objective cloud quality assessment methods
