where the image pixels are m*n, I(i, j) represents the reference 
point cloud sequence view pixel points , K(i, j) represents the 
quantized distortion point cloud sequence view pixel points , and 
MAX denotes the possible maximum pixel value of the image .
The improvement ratios of PSNR of the proposed method 
are shown in Table 2.
As can be seen from Table 2, the PSNR of each point 
cloud sequence has been improved using the proposed 
method regardless of the size of the geometric quantization 
parameters . As the geometric quantization parameter in ⁃
creases , more points are retained in the point cloud se ⁃
quence . Therefore , for the same point cloud sequence , the ad ⁃
vantage of the proposed method will be more significant with 
the increase in the density of the point cloud sequence . The 
reasons for the above phenomenon are that sparse point 
clouds are more likely to produce outliers , and the original 
point rendering will have worse subjective perception quality 
so that the PSNR improvement ratio will be more pro ⁃
nounced . After rendering through outlier detection , the 
PSNR of each point cloud sequence is improved . Specifi ⁃
cally , the average PSNR improvement ratio is 3.6%.
3.3 Time Complexity
Specifically , we record the rendering time in the experiment 
in Section 3.2. Then we calculate the ratio of increased render ⁃
ing time spent for the original rendering and the proposed ren ⁃
dering , as shown in Eq . (10).
Tr=T1-T0
T0×100%, (10)where Tr is the ratio of increased rendering time , T1 is the 
rendering time using the proposed method , and T0 is the 
original rendering time . The calculation results are shown 
in Table 3.
Observing the results , we can conclude that the rendering 
time is increased by 5.8% on average due to the added outlier 
detection .
3.4 Ablation Studies
To evaluate the effectiveness of using the local and global 
geometric features in outlier detection , we conduct studies us ⁃
ing three -point cloud sequences : Andrew , David and Phil . For 
quantization , we still use the same geometric quantization pa ⁃
rameters as set in Section 3.2: {1/10,1/2,15/18}.
The local and global geometric features are respectively 
used and then compared with the original rendering without 
optimization . For performance evaluation , the individual point 
cloud sequences are also projected onto the three planes of 
the point cloud enclosing the box to get the view from the cor ⁃
responding perspective . The PSNR of the point cloud se ⁃
quences under each rendering method is calculated from the 
undistorted point cloud sequence image and distorted point 
cloud sequence image . Finally , we calculate the average 
PSNR improvement compared with the original rendering 
method , as shown in Table 4.
It is seen that both local and global geometric features con ⁃
tribute to improving the quality of the point cloud sequence . 
However , both individual features are less effective than using 
both. In addition , the local geometric feature contributes more 
compared with the global geometric feature .
