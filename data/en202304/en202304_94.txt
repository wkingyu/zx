Abstract : With the rapid development of immersive multimedia technologies , 360 -degree video services have quickly gained popularity and 
how to ensure sufficient spatial presence of end users when viewing 360 -degree videos becomes a new challenge . In this regard , accurately ac ⁃
quiring users ’ sense of spatial presence is of fundamental importance for video service providers to improve their service quality . Unfortu ⁃
nately , there is no efficient evaluation model so far for measuring the sense of spatial presence for 360 -degree videos . In this paper , we first de ⁃
sign an assessment framework to clarify the influencing factors of spatial presence . Related parameters of 360 -degree videos and head -
mounted display devices are both considered in this framework . Well -designed subjective experiments are then conducted to investigate the 
impact of various influencing factors on the sense of presence . Based on the subjective ratings , we propose a spatial presence assessment 
model that can be easily deployed in 360 -degree video applications . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt in literature to estab ⁃
lish a quantitative spatial presence assessment model by using technical parameters that are easily extracted . Experimental results demon ⁃
strate that the proposed model can reliably predict the sense of spatial presence .

1 Introduction
In the past decade , multimedia streaming services have 
had an explosive growth[1]. Among a variety of multimedia 
types , 360 -degree videos become the major type of virtual 
reality (VR) content in the current stage . Major video -
sharing websites such as YouTube and Facebook have already 
started to offer 360 -degree video -on-demand and live 360 -de⁃
gree video streaming services .
In contrast to traditional 2D videos , 360 -degree videos can 
provide full 360 -degree scenes to end users , using the Head -
Mounted Display (HMD ) as a display device . With a higher 
degree of freedom (DoF) and wider field of view (FOV ) during 
the viewing process , end users are provided with a stronger 
sense of immersion and a feeling of being in a perceptible vir ⁃
tual scene around the users . Different from the experience of 
traditional 2D videos[2–3], this type of feeling is usually termed as presence[4–7]. According to the classification of presence in 
Refs. [8] and [9], presence covers a broad range of aspects in ⁃
cluding spatial presence , social presence , self -presence[10], en⁃
gagement , realism , and cultural presence . In the field of 360 -
degree video processing , researchers are more interested in 
spatial presence , which describes the feeling , sense , or state 
of “being there ” in a mediated environment[4]. This feeling oc ⁃
curs when part or all of a person ’s perception fails to accu ⁃
rately acknowledge the role of technology that makes it appear 
that she/he is in a physical location and environment different 
from her/his actual location and environment in the physical 
world[11].
Over the last twenty years , a variety of work has been con ⁃
ducted to investigate the users ’ sense of presence in VR envi ⁃
ronments , especially for scenes rendered by computers[12–13]. 
These studies mainly focused on measuring specific influenc ⁃
ing factors of the sense of presence and revealing the qualita ⁃
tive relationship between presence and specific human percep ⁃
tual aspects in a generalized VR environment . Directly quanti ⁃
fying the sense of presence is , however , outside the scope of
