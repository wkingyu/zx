We evaluate the probability of topic appearance for each in ⁃
cident ticket and then cluster the topics using K-means . Fig. 4 
shows the SSE curve and silhouette coefficient curve respec ⁃
tively . The curves demonstrate more significant turning points 
than the ones using the BoW model , indicating the LDA 
model is more suitable for incident ticket clustering .
With 14 topics , the SSE of LDA -allocated tokens is about 
20, while the SSE of BoW is about 215, an order of higher 
magnitude . Though it is unpragmatic to map the SSE score to 
the exact accuracy , the lower the score the more accurate the 
prediction . Similarly , the silhouette coefficient for LDA results 
with 14 topics are about 0.37, compared with less than 0.10 
using BoW models . As the score measures how apart of the 
cluster ranging from −1 to 1, a value close to 1 indicates 
clearly distinguished clusters .
Table 3 shows the titles of tickets in one cluster . Storage 
related problems consist of a majority of the tickets , espe ⁃
cially during upgrade and backup stages . The next is net ⁃
working issues .
4.4 Incident Ticket Classification and Prediction
Our ticket clustering experiments reveal that incident tick ⁃
ets do have clustering characteristics . In order to take full ad ⁃
vantage of prior knowledge , e.g., to assign coming tickets to 
the same department which has resolved similar ones before , 
we study the classification and prediction of incident tickets 
in this section . We use a similar dataset with more fields , in⁃
cluding ticket ID , ticket description , resolution , resolution 
groups , categories , sub -categories , and components . After re ⁃
moving null values , the categories and record numbers are 
shown in Table 4.
There are 115 sub -categories and 49 of them contain 1 000 
records or more . The 49 sub -categories consist of 96% of the 
total tickets , and 30 of them contain 3 000 records or more 
consisting of 87% of the total records . When it comes to com ⁃
ponents , there are 663 in total , among which there are 88 
items with more than 1 000 records accounting for 79% of the 
total amount , and 34 items with more than 3 000 records ac ⁃▼Table 3. Samples of title descriptions in one cluster
