For run lengths less than or equal to n, there may be 2n of 
tree nodes representing the occupancy states of voxels . There ⁃
fore, the probability of any occupied voxel is represented by 
the independent joint probability of traversing all states start ⁃
ing at the root and ending at any childless node of the tree .
Based on Eq . (4), to perform arithmetic encoding on the oc ⁃
cupancy of the voxel sequence , we need the cumulative upper 
and lower probabilities of the sequence , as shown in Eq . (5).

High()l=∑r=1lP(r)=∑r=1lp()1|cr∙∏i=1rp(0|ci) .(5)
Employing this approach , we can utilize the adaptive prop ⁃
erties of arithmetic coding to adjust the probability estimation 
value of each symbol based on the optimized probability esti ⁃
mation model and the frequency of each symbol in the current 
symbol sequence . This allows us to calculate the upper and 
lower bounds of the cumulative probability of occupied voxels 
and complete the encoding process .
4 Experiment
4.1 Implementation Details
1) Dataset . To verify the performance of our proposed 
method , extensive experiments were conducted over 16 point 
cloud datasets that can be downloaded from Ref . [40], as 
shown in Fig . 3, in which Figs . 3(a)–3(l) are portraits with 
dense points , and Figs . 3(m)–3(p) are architecture with 
sparse points . Figs . 3(a)–3(h) are voxelized upper bodies 
point cloud data sequences of two spatial resolutions obtained 
from Microsoft . Figs . 3(i)–3(l) are chosen from 8i voxelized 
full bodies point cloud data sequences . Remaining large -scale 
sparse point clouds in Figs . 3(k)–3(p) are static facade and 
architecture datasets .
2) Evaluation metrics . The performance of the proposed 
method is evaluated in terms of bit per point (BPP). The BPP 
refers to the sum of bits occupied by the coordinate informa ⁃
tion attached to the point . The lower the value , the better the 
performance .
BPP=Sizedig
k , (6)
where Sizedig represents the number of bits occupied by the co ⁃
ordinate information of point cloud data , and k refers to the 
number of points in the original point cloud .
3) Benchmarks . We mainly compare our method with other 
baseline algorithms , including : PCL -PCC: octree -based com ⁃
pression in PCL ; G-PCC (MPEG intra -coders test model ) and 
interEM (MPEG inter -coders test model ) target single -frame 
and multi -frame point cloud compression respectively ; The Sil ⁃
houette 3D (S3D)[41] and Silhouette 4D (S4D)[42] target single -
frame and multi -frame point cloud compression , respectively . For PCL , we use the octree point cloud compression approach 
in PCL -v1.8.1 for geometry compression only . We set octree 
resolution parameters from point precision and voxel resolu ⁃
tion. For G -PCC (TM13-v11.0), we choose a loss less geometry
—lossless attributes condition in an octree -predictive mode , 
leaving parameters as default . For interEM (tmc3v3.0), we 
use the experimental results under lossless geometry and
