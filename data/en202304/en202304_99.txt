500 ms, respectively . We adopted the 5-point spatial pres ⁃
ence scale proposed in Ref . [43] where a point from 5 to 1 in⁃
dicates the degree of being there from “very strong ” to “not 
at all ”. The question designed in the experiment was “To 
what extent did you feel like you were really inside the virtual 
environment ?”.
After the subjective tests , the reliability of the subjective re ⁃
sults in each experiment was checked using the Pearson Lin ⁃
ear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC ) adopted by ITU -T Recom ⁃
mendation P .913[38]. According to the suggested threshold of 
0.75[38], only the results from two subjects were discarded .
4 Spatial Presence Assessment Model
In the previous section , we construct several test scenarios 
under different impact factor settings and launched subjective 
experiments to obtain users ’ rating scores . These scores are 
the ground truth of spatial presence under different impact fac ⁃
tor settings . In this section , the characteristic of users ’ percep ⁃
tion in each module is analyzed based on the preliminary ob ⁃
servation of the experiment results . The weight of each impact 
factor is determined using the linear regression method .
4.1 Perceptual Video Quality Assessment Module
As studied in Refs . [44] and [45], the impact of frame rate 
and quantization is separable . We follow this conclusion and 
hypothesize that the perceptual video quality can be predicted 
as follows :
PVQ(BPP, f)=SQF(BPP)⋅TCF(f), (2)
where f represents the frame rate and BPP is the bits per 
pixel . SQF and TCF are the spatial quality factor and temporal 
correction factor , respectively . The first term SQF (BPP) mea ⁃
sures the quality of encoded frames without considering the 
impact of frame rate . The second term models how the Mean 
Opinion Score (MOS ) varies with the change of frame rate .
4.1.1 Temporal Correction Factor
Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the frame rate and 
the perceptual video quality . We can see that the perceptual 
video quality increases along with the rise of frame rate . Fig. 4 
presents the experimental results of the two videos encoded 
with four different QPs . It can be found that no matter what 
the QP level is , MOS reduces consistently as the frame rate de ⁃
creases . In order to examine whether the decreasing trend of 
MOS against the frame rate is independent of the QP , the 
MOS scores were normalized and shown in Fig . 5, where the 
normalized MOS (NMOS ) is the ratio of the MOS with the 
MOS at 30 fps. More specifically , the NMOS is calculated as
NMOS(QP, f)=MOS() QP,  f
MOS() QP, 30 . (3)As can be seen in Fig . 5, these NMOS scores corresponding 
to different QPs almost overlap with each other , indicating
