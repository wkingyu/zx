The average Euclidean distance of the N nearest neighbor ⁃
ing points is taken as the rendering radius of the point . Thus 
the rendering radius ri of the i-th point is :
ri=1
N×∑
n=1N
  (xn
i, yn
i, zn
i)-(xi, yi, zi)2
. (1)
As can be seen from the above equation , outlier points far 
away from the central region of the point cloud sequence will 
have too sizeable Euclidean distance from their nearest neigh ⁃
bors, and thus , the rendering radius ri will be too large , which 
in turn results in an impaired subjective perception of the 
quality of the rendered point cloud sequence .
In order to solve the problem of too large a rendering ra ⁃
dius of outlier points in the above method , we need to add a 
process of detecting and determining outlier points before 
rendering each point in the point cloud sequence . We deter ⁃
mine whether each point is an outlier , filter the outlier points 
and change their rendering radii . For the outlier points , the 
minimum rendering radius is used . For the non -outlier 
points , the radius of the nearest neighbor rendering ri is used 
as shown in Eq . (1).
Outlier detection is a commonly used detection method in 
data analysis and processing , often used to identify abnormal 
samples or points in outlier states that significantly deviate 
from the central region of the sequence . Many outlier mining 
methods can be categorized into five groups : distribution -
based , depth -based , clustering -based , distance -based , and 
density -based[14–15]. Commonly used detection methods are 
distance detection -based K -nearest neighbor algorithms , iso⁃
lated forest methods , clustering -based DBSCAN algorithms[16], 
LOF algorithms[17], supervised or unsupervised algorithms 
based on machine learning[18], and distribution -based and 
density -based outlier detection[19]. However , the above meth ⁃
ods have the disadvantages of high time complexity , poor de ⁃
tection results in high -dimensional sparseness , and insignifi ⁃
cant mathematical geometric features .
Since determining the rendering radius in terms of the near ⁃
est neighboring points is through geometric features , detecting 
outlier states at each point based on geometric features is rea ⁃
sonable . To ensure the accuracy of detection , global and local 
geometric features construct a comprehensive judgment condi ⁃
tion to quickly check and judge whether the current point is in 
an outlier state .
The implementation complexity of the detection method 
needs to be as low as possible for rendering . So we use dis ⁃
crete point detection techniques based on statistical distribu ⁃
tions , combining local and global geometric features to judge 
outliers . This is a method that has solid probabilistic statisti ⁃
cal theory support . After modeling , it does not require model -
based data , and only the minimum amount of information de ⁃
scribing the model needs to be stored , which can effectively re ⁃
duce the data storage .2.2 Construction of Outlier Judgment Conditions
The basic principle of the algorithm for point cloud render ⁃
ing through outlier detection in this paper is to determine 
whether the detected point is in an outlier state by judging 
whether the point satisfies the distribution type of the dataset 
and, thus , whether the point is in an outlier state . Assuming 
that the data satisfy the condition of obeying normal distribu ⁃
tion, p0 belongs to the dataset p, and the mean and standard 
deviation of this dataset are pˉ and σ, respectively . The judg ⁃
ment criteria of outlier detection are shown in Eq . (2)[20]. When 
Eq. (2) is not satisfied , the point p0 is determined to be in an 
outlier state .

From Eq . (1), we can see that the rendering method based 
on the nearest neighbor distance determines the size of the 
rendering radius of each point in the point cloud sequence by 
the geometric density feature in the local area . Therefore , the 
geometric features of outlier points are also chosen as density 
features in this method , i.e., the rendering radius is calculated 
based on the nearest -neighbor distance .
Let the rendering radius of the nearest N (N=10) neigh ⁃
bors of the detection point be rn
i, the mean value of the local 
geometric density feature be E(r), and the standard deviation 
be σr. E(r) and σr are calculated in Eqs . (3) and (4).

Combining the outlier judgment criteria , we substitute the 
rendering radius data into Eq . (2), and the outlier judgment 
criteria for the local geometric feature construction are shown 
as follows[12]:

When the detection point does not satisfy the local determi ⁃
nation condition of the above equation , it is determined that 
the detection point is in the outlier state .
Since the number of detected points in the point set covered 
by the local geometric features is small , only local features are
