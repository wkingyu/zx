Abstract : Falls are a major cause of disability and even death in the elderly , and fall detection can effectively reduce the damage . Compared 
with cameras and wearable sensors , Wi -Fi devices can protect user privacy and are inexpensive and easy to deploy . Wi -Fi devices sense user ac ⁃
tivity by analyzing the channel state information (CSI) of the received signal , which makes fall detection possible . We propose a fall detection sys ⁃
tem based on commercial Wi -Fi devices which achieves good performance . In the feature extraction stage , we select the discrete wavelet trans ⁃
form (DWT ) spectrum as the feature for activity classification , which can balance the temporal and spatial resolution . In the feature classification 
stage , we design a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks , which has better performance compared with other traditional 
machine learning models . Experimental results show our work achieves a false alarm rate of 4.8% and a missed alarm rate of 1.9%.

1 Introduction
Population aging  is a common phenomenon in the world 
today , and the health as well as safety of the elderly is 
a growing concern . Every year , one -third of the elderly 
people over 65 fall down , resulting in injury or even 
death[1]. Most of the elderly deaths caused by falls are due to 
untimely treatment , so fall detection has become an important 
method to prevent fall -related deaths in the elderly .
Extensive research has been conducted on fall detection 
techniques . Traditional methods mainly use cameras[2–3], 
wearable sensors[4–5], and ambient environment sensing -based 
approaches[6–8] for fall detection . Camera -based detection sys ⁃
tems require infrastructure deployment and video data collec ⁃
tion, which raises the user ’s privacy concerns . Solutions 
based on wearable sensors require users to carry specific de ⁃
vices , which is inconvenient . Ambient environment sensing -
based approaches require specific infrastructures (e.g., radar 
and infrared ) and are expensive , which prevents them from 
pervasive applications . Therefore , it is important to find a fall 
detection solution that is device -independent , privacy protect ⁃
ing, secure , inexpensive and easy to deploy . The emergence of 
commercial Wi -Fi[9–10], which can effectively meet these con ⁃
ditions , has also received a lot of attention from researchers . Wi-Fi devices sense the user ’s activity by analyzing the chan ⁃
nel state information (CSI) of the received signal , which en ⁃
ables various applications such as gesture recognition[11–12], 
gait recognition[13–14], and trajectory tracking[15–16], and there ⁃
fore we have found an opportunity that Wi -Fi has the feasibil ⁃
ity of performing fall detection .
Most existing work can be divided into two stages : feature 
extraction and feature classification . Feature extraction refers 
to the extraction of parameters from the original Wi -Fi signal 
as human fall features , and feature classification refers to the 
construction of classifiers to identify fall actions based on vari ⁃
ous classification methods . In feature extraction , most existing 
work can be divided into two categories . The first category is 
to directly use the original features in the received signal , 
mainly the amplitude and phase information of CSI , including 
WiFall[17], RT -Fall[18], Anti -Fall[19], FallViewer[20], etc. WiFall 
is the first work that utilizes commercial Wi -Fi devices for fall 
detection , which characterizes human activity by using the 
fluctuation of the amplitude of CSI . Furthermore , Anti -fall 
combines the amplitude and phase information of CSI to char ⁃
acterize human activities . Considering that the phase of CSI 
collected by commercial devices contains random noise , RT -
Fall reduces the impact of random phase by calculating the
