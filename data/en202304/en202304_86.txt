order voltage ripple of the output voltage is less than 20 V, 
and the current sinusoidal degree satisfies THD= 3.89%.
Fig. 10 shows the experimental waveform of transient switch ⁃
ing. As shown in Fig . 10(a), when the reference voltage changes 
from 370 V to 400 V, the output voltage reaches the new steady -
state value within one period (13 ms) without significant over ⁃
voltage . As shown in Fig . 10(b), in the case of full load switch ⁃
ing to half load , the amplitude of AC stabilizes at 1/2 of its origi ⁃
nal value after a short fluctuation . Transient experimental re ⁃
sults show that the closed -loop control strategy has good dy ⁃
namic response performance .
The experimental waveform under the DC input condition is 
shown in Fig . 11, where the input voltage is 120 V and the out ⁃
put voltage is 200 V. The bridge arm voltage can be composed of two levels , namely , 100 V and 200 V. Therefore , the feasi ⁃
bility of the control strategy is verified .
4 Conclusions
To achieve low common -mode voltage and high power den ⁃
sity, this paper proposes a multilevel PFC topology suitable 
for the communication power supply of 5G base stations . It is 
a hybrid topology consisting of a five -level ANPC bridge and 
a diode bridge . A 1 kW experimental prototype is estab ⁃
lished , which verifies the proposed working principle and 
control strategy .
Using the modulation strategy of PS -PWM , the converter 
produces seven levels while the d v/dt is reduced to Vdc/7, 
which greatly inhibits the common -mode voltage and reduces 
the leakage current . Moreover , by adjusting the redundancy 
switching state action time to balance the flying capacitor volt ⁃
age, the total harmonic distortion can be suppressed by less 
than 4%. A dual closed loop system with PI control of the volt ⁃
age outer loop and quasi -proportion resonant (quasi -PR) con⁃
trol of the current inner loop is used to realize zero static error 
tracking . The output voltage is stable within an allowable de ⁃
viation range , and the control performance is great . Further ⁃
more , the AC and DC input switching is realized to ensure the 
reliability and flexibility of the power supply .
