electric coupling or magnetic coupling is slightly stronger than 
the other one to provide a weak total coupling for constructing 
the narrowband passband . Therefore , if the absolute value of 
the synthesized capacitance matrix element Cij is larger , the 
electric and magnetic coupling in the mixed coupling struc ⁃
ture should be tuned stronger simultaneously .
To conclude , the FDC in the lowpass coupling matrix model 
is sCij+jMij, where Mij represents the total coupling exhibited 
by the mixed electric and magnetic coupling at the center fre ⁃
quency , and Cm is related to the strength of both the electric 
and the magnetic coupling coefficient in the mixed coupling .
3 Analysis of Electromagnetic Model
For the experimental validation , a 7th-order in -line bandpass 
filter is designed with coaxial cavity structures in this section . 
The 7th-order filter contains two mixed electric and magnetic 
couplings , the structure of which is shown in Fig . 3(a). The 
simulation results of the second -order filter block are shown in 
Fig. 3(b). The center frequency of the filter is 3.5 GHz , the 
bandwidth is 0.2 GHz , and the return loss is 18 dB. The open end of the metal rod is connected to a folded metal sheet . 
Two adjacent metal sheets form a parallel plate capacitor to 
realize a strong electric coupling . The height of the plate 
hplate is 3.6 mm. The short ends of adjacent coaxial resonators 
are connected by a metal ridge to realize a strong magnetic 
coupling . The height of the ridge ，hridge， is 6.3 mm . The 
strong electrical coupling and the magnetic coupling exist si ⁃
multaneously to form a mixed electric and magnetic cou ⁃
pling . If hplate or hridge increases , the electric coupling or mag ⁃
netic coupling will become stronger in this design .
By repeatedly applying the MVF technique to extract the 
coupling matrix from simulation data[12], we can study the rela ⁃
tionship between the mixed coupling coefficients and the ele ⁃
ment values of the coupling and capacitance matrices . Tables 
1 and 2 show the extracted values of Mij and Cij when EC and 
MC are changed . It can be found from Table 1 that when hridge 
and hplate increase simultaneously , Cij increases , whereas Mij al⁃
most does not change . Therefore , Cij is related to both the elec ⁃
tric and magnetic coupling coefficients in the mixed coupling .
Table 2 shows that when EC increases and MC decreases , Mij 
increases . Since  Mij represents the total coupling exhibited by 
the mixed electric and magnetic coupling at the center fre ⁃
quency , it can be seen that EC is stronger than MC in the mixed 
coupling structure shown in Fig . 3(a). Table 2 also shows that 
we can control Mij by increasing the difference between EC 
and MC without affecting Cij.
Table 3 shows that when MC increases , the TZ is shifted to
