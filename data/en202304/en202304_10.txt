more attention in subjective PCQA research . JAVAHERI et 
al. established the IRPC database , studying the impact of 
three different encoding methods and three rendering solu ⁃
tions on the visual perceptual quality of point clouds[19]. Addi ⁃
tionally , the authors creatively evaluated the performance of 
the encoding scheme proposed by MPEG . PERRY et al . con⁃
firmed that VPCC ’s compression performance on static con ⁃
tent is superior to GPCC through subjective point cloud qual ⁃
ity assessment experiments conducted in four independent 
labs against the established ICIP 2020  database[31]. In the data ⁃
bases established in recent years , the types of distortions are 
more standardized and comprehensive . The WPC database es ⁃
tablished by LIU et al . covers Gaussian noise , downsampling , 
GPCC , and VPCC[5]. YANG et al . established the SJTU -
PCQA[6], which simulates distortions during the communica ⁃
tion process , including octree -based compression , color noise , 
geometric noise , and scaling enhancement .
To more intuitively and clearly exhibit the development of 
point cloud subjective databases , we have listed the information 
of some databases in recent years in Table 2. From Table 2, we 
can surmise that subjective PCQA databases are striving to de ⁃
velop in the direction of larger scale , more comprehensive dis ⁃
tortions , and more realistic and richer point cloud models .3 Objective Point Cloud Quality Assessment
Although subjective quality evaluation is considered to be 
the test method that best matches the visual perception of the 
human eye , conducting subjective experiments often costs a 
great deal of labor and time . Therefore , objective point cloud 
quality evaluation has emerged as a promising alternative to 
alleviate the drawbacks of subjective evaluations . Some objec ⁃
tive point cloud quality evaluation methods are listed in Table 
3. As with traditional image or video quality assessment , de⁃
fined from the perspective of the amount of reference informa ⁃
tion, objective PCQA methods can be categorized into full -
reference (FR), reduced -reference (RR), and no -reference 
(NR) assessment methods . Within this classification , FR 
PCQA methods are distinguished by their utilization of com ⁃
plete reference point clouds during the assessment of distorted 
point clouds . Conversely , NR PCQA methods rely exclusively 
on the distorted point clouds for quality evaluation , without ac ⁃
cess to the reference point clouds . The RR PCQA methods 
possess the capability to employ a subset of feature informa ⁃
tion extracted from the reference point clouds as reference . 
Subsequently , they conduct a comparative and analytical 
evaluation of the distorted point clouds , culminating in the 
derivation of quality assessment outcomes . As defined by the 
feature extraction method , the objective PCQA methods can
