1) It derives the explicit relationship between EC (Mc) in the 
mixed electric and magnetic coupling and elements in the cou ⁃
pling and capacitance matrices .
2) The filter tuning procedure is based on analytical cou ⁃
pling matrix extraction and thus is very fast , compared with 
optimization -based filter tuning techniques .
This paper gives a guiding idea for designing the physical 
model of the mixed electric and magnetic coupling filter .
