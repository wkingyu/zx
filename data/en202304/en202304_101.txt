where v4 and v5 are the model coefficients that can be obtained 
by regression . The values of v4 and v5 are listed in Table 4. It 
can be seen that the values of v4 are very close to each other 
while that of v5 are quite distinct for different video resolu ⁃
tions . Hence , the average value of v4 is used as a fixed coeffi ⁃
cient . The value of v5 is then regressed again .
To reflect the impact of video resolution and screen resolu ⁃
tion on perceived video quality , we employ the integrated as ⁃
sessment parameter that we proposed in the previous work[46], 
i.e., the number of effective video pixels per degree (ED -PPD) 
displayed on the screen of HMD . The effective pixels do not 
include the pixels interpolated by the up -sampling process . 
This parameter is calculated as
ED-PPD=ì

where RH and RSH are the horizontal resolution of 360 -degree 
video and screen , respectively . When the horizontal pixels of 
the video displayed on the screen are more than the horizontal 
pixels on the screen , the ED -PPD will be saturated .
Fig. 7 shows the relationship between the ED -PPD and v5. 
It can be seen that the values of v5 and ED -PPD are in accor ⁃
dance with the power function relationship , which can be ex ⁃
pressed as
v5=v6⋅ED-PPDv7, (7)where v6 and v7 are equal to 0.011 7 and 2.962, respectively .
By substituting Eqs . (4), (5) and (7) into Eq . (2), the percep ⁃
tual video quality of 360 -degree videos can be modeled .
4.2 Visual Realism Assessment
According to the results of Experiment 2, Fig. 8 shows the 
relationship between perceptual video quality and visual real ⁃
ism. It can be seen that there is a strong correlation between 
the perceptual video quality and visual realism . For the influ ⁃
ence of FOV , it can be observed that a higher FOV leads to a 
higher visual realism . The Kruskal -Wallis H test showed that 
there is a significant effect of FOV on visual realism , with p = 
0.001 for monoscopic videos and p = 0.039 for stereoscopic
