tionship can be represented by
DMOS(MTP)=max(min(ln(v16MTP+1), 4), 0), (13)
DMOS(AL)=max(min(v17ln(v18AL+1), 4), 0), (14)
where v16, v17 and v18 are equal to 0.065 46, 0.428 9 and 0.275 4, 
respectively . We modeled the proprioceptive matching as
PM(MTP,AL)=max(min(5-DMOS(MTP)-
DMOS(AL), 5), 1). (15)
4.5 Spatial Presence Assessment
First, the relationship between the visual/acoustic realism 
and the spatial presence is modeled . As shown in Fig . 13, the 
spatial presence increases with the rise of VRE and ARE . 
This phenomenon confirms the conclusion drawn in our previ ⁃
ous work[18]. The relationship shown in Fig . 13 can be calcu ⁃
lated as
SPAV(VRE, ARE)=min(max(v19VRE+v20ARE+
v21VRE×ARE+v22, 1), 5), (16)
where v19, v20, v21, and v22 are equal to 1.285, 0.01, 0.027 4, 
and −1.529, respectively ; SPAV represents the spatial pres ⁃
ence provided by the visual and acoustic experience .
Second , the impact of proprioceptive matching is investi ⁃
gated . Fig. 14 shows the relationship between the propriocep ⁃
tive matching and the degradation of spatial presence . We can 
find that the degradation of spatial presence decreases with 
the increase of proprioceptive matching . The relationship in Fig. 14 can be modeled as
DSP(PM)=v23⋅exp(v24⋅PM)+v25 , (17)
where v23, v24 and v25 are equal to −0.467 9, 0.533 8 and 4.367, 
respectively . Hence , the spatial presence can be calculated by
SP(SPAV, DSP)=min(max(SPAV-DSP, 1), 5). (18)
By utilizing the proposed model , the spatial presence of
