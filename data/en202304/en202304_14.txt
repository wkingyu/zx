to determine the strength of the correlation coefficient . It can 
also be used to describe the monotonicity of visual quality pre ⁃
diction , with its value ranging from 0 to 1. The closer KRCC is 
to 1, the better the performance of the model is considered to 
be. Eq. 5 provides the calculation process of RMSE :
RMSE=1
N∑
i=1N
() pi-si2
, (5)
where si and pi similarly represent the subjective score and the 
objective score after nonlinear mapping of the i-th point cloud . 
RMSE can be used to measure the accuracy of visual quality 
prediction . The lower the RMSE value , the better the perfor ⁃
mance of the model is considered to be .
4.2 Performance Comparison
In this section , we summarize the performance of common 
PCQA methods . Since not all surveyed methods are publicly 
available , we did not include all of them in the evaluation . We 
selected four widely used PCQA databases : IRPC[19], 
CPCD 2.0[42], SJTU -PCQA[6], and WPC[5], to test all participat ⁃ing evaluation methods . Specifically , we reported the SRCC , 
PLCC , KRCC and RMSE metrics for full -reference , reduced -
reference , and no -reference quality assessment methods in 
Tables 4 and 5. It is worth stating that this chapter also reports 
some commonly used image and video quality evaluation 
methods to provide a more comprehensive assessment of ob ⁃
jective point cloud quality evaluation methods . This is be ⁃
cause projection -based methods are essentially a dimensional ⁃
ity reduction process , allowing 3D point clouds to be evalu ⁃
ated by 2D image or video quality evaluation methods as well .
Combining Tables 4 and 5, we can see that most of the 
methods with optimal performance take into account the fea ⁃
tures provided by the 3D model itself . This result proves that 
3D models do provide more effective quality features than 2D 
projections . On the other hand , we can also see that the cur ⁃
rent projection -based methods represented by VQA -PC[84] 
have also achieved notable performance . One possible expla ⁃
nation is that VQA -PC focuses on dynamic quality -aware in ⁃
formation , and recording the point cloud as a video through 
four moving paths allows for more point cloud detail from dif ⁃
ferent viewpoints , thus preserving as much of the point

ric is marked in bold and underlined bold respectively . The IQA and VQA methods are marked with * superscript
