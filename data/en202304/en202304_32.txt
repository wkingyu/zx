Abstract : Recent years have witnessed that 3D point cloud compression (PCC) has become a research hotspot both in academia and industry . 
Especially in industry , the Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG ) has actively initiated the development of PCC standards . One of the adopted 
frameworks called geometry -based PCC (G-PCC) follows the architecture of coding geometry first and then coding attributes , where the region 
adaptive hierarchical transform (RAHT ) method is introduced for the lossy attribute compression . The upsampled transform domain predic ⁃
tion in RAHT does not sufficiently explore the attribute correlations between neighbor nodes and thus fails to further reduce the attribute re ⁃
dundancy between neighbor nodes . In this paper , we propose a subnode -based prediction method , where the spatial position relationship be ⁃
tween neighbor nodes is fully considered and prediction precision is further promoted . We utilize some already -encoded neighbor nodes to fa ⁃
cilitate the upsampled transform domain prediction in RAHT by means of a weighted average strategy . Experimental results have illustrated 
that our proposed attribute compression method shows better rate -distortion (R-D) performance than the latest MPEG G -PCC (both on refer ⁃
ence software TMC 13-v22.0 and GeS -TM -v2.0).

1 Introduction
Rapid progress in 3D graphic technologies and capture 
devices has enabled high -precision digital representa ⁃
tions of 3D objects or scenes . Point clouds , as one of 
the mainstream 3D data formats , can effectively indi ⁃
cate points in real -world scenes through 3D geometric coordi ⁃
nates and corresponding attributes (e.g., color , normal and re ⁃
flectance ). Considering its flexible representation properties , 
point clouds have been widely applied to various fields , such 
as autonomous driving , free -viewpoint broadcasting , and heri ⁃
tage reconstruction[1]. However , in addition to a huge amount 
of data , point clouds are non -uniformly sampled in space , 
which undoubtedly makes it unfeasible to put point clouds 
into applications with limited bandwidth and storage space[2]. 
Therefore , it is necessary to investigate efficient point cloud 
compression (PCC) schemes .
With an increasing demand for point cloud applications , the Moving Picture Expert Group (MPEG ) standardization commit ⁃
tee started to conduct PCC -dedicated standards and issued a 
Call for Proposals (CfP) in 2017[3]. After intensive develop ⁃
ments involving academic and industrial meetings , two inde ⁃
pendent point cloud compression frameworks have been ad ⁃
opted to cover a wider range of immersive applications and 
data types . One called video -based PCC (V-PCC)[4] adopts 
projection -based strategies combined with video codecs , 
which aims for handling dense point clouds . Another called 
geometry -based PCC (G-PCC)[5] is more specifically designed 
for relatively sparse point clouds by using the octree -based ar ⁃
chitecture . The octree representation first proposed for PCC in 
Ref. [6] can build a progressive 3D structure for point clouds . 
Specifically , by recursively dividing point clouds from the root 
node to leaf nodes , the connectivity information between 
points can be exploited among the unorganized point clouds . 
Moreover , the topological neighbor information makes it easier 
to implement techniques similar to prediction or transforma ⁃
tion in video coding . In the current G -PCC scheme , geometry 
and attributes are coded sequentially and multiple coding 
tools can be selected to suit different application scenarios .
