enough . To ensure a stable anchoring effect , a 
filtering manner is used to optimize the position ⁃
ing algorithm as follows .
1) A high -pass filter and a low -pass filter are 
used to eliminate incorrect positioning (Fig. 4)；
2) The camera position information of the 
first k frames and the sliding average value are 
used to smooth the track of the current frame .
Because the original environment on the web 
side supports only a single thread and the loca ⁃
tion algorithm based on the local point cloud 
cannot meet the real -time requirement (20 fps) 
with limited computing resources on the web 
side, the proposed algorithm is optimized by de ⁃
laying video frames (Fig. 5). To ensure the sta ⁃
bility of the local point cloud positioning algo ⁃
rithm , the optical flow tracking algorithm is in ⁃
troduced to improve the number of 2D-3D 
matches by using the previous frame ’s prior 
knowledge , as shown in Fig . 6. Figs 7 and 8 
show the experimental results without and with 
the optical flow respectively . The stability of 
model anchoring is improved during the posi ⁃
tioning process .
4 Conclusions
This paper proposes a Web AR indoor navi ⁃
gation system based on local point cloud map 
positioning , which has beneficial effects on 
technical value compared with the prior art . It 
innovatively proposes the idea of point -cloud distribution , 
that is , to download the map of local point -cloud to the Web 
front end and use the computing power of the Web front end 
for positioning . Compared with an existing mainstream visual -
based positioning manner for AR navigation , GPS -based posi ⁃
tioning manner and multi -sensor fusion positioning manner , 
the positioning manner provided in the present invention 
does not depend on any additional sensor or external comput ⁃
ing environment , thereby reducing development and deploy ⁃
ment costs .
A lightweight web front -end positioning algorithm is pre ⁃
sented for indoor Web AR navigation when the computational 
power of the web front -end is limited . A degree of dependence 
on network communication is reduced , the requirement of 
Web AR navigation on a network environment is reduced , and 
environment adaptability is improved . It takes a short time to 
deliver the web front -end positioning system to the point cloud 
for indoor Web AR navigation . In a small -scale indoor scenario , 
the positioning frequency on the iPhone 13 can reach 90 fps, 
which brings users a smooth user experience based on satisfying 
the real -time positioning requirements for Web AR navigation .
