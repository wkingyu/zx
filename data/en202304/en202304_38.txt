gains can be achieved both under C 1 and C 2 conditions for all 
categories . Specifically , 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.5% bitrate reduc ⁃
tion for luma , chorma and reflectance are obtained under the 
C1 condition respectively . 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.2% bitrate re ⁃
duction for luma , chroma Cb and Cr as well as 0.2% bitrate re ⁃
duction for reflectance are obtained under C 2 condition re ⁃
spectively . Especially for Am -fused datasets , there are over 
1% coding gains under the C 1 condition for chroma Cb 
(1.2%), chroma Cr (1.1%) and reflectance (1.1%). Besides the 
R-D performance , the computational complexity is evaluated 
by using the average encoding and decoding time . There are 
only 2% and 3% extra increases on the encoding and decod ⁃
ing time on the C 1 condition , with no complexity increase for 
encoding on the C 2 condition .
Apart from TMC 13-v22.0, we also compare our proposed 
method with GeSTM -v2.0 for Cat 2. As shown in Table 3, 
consistent coding gains can be also achieved both under C 1 
and C 2 conditions for all Cat 2 datasets . Specifically , 0.4%, 
0.4% and 0.5% bitrate reduction for luma , chroma Cb and 
chroma Cr are obtained under the C 1 condition respec ⁃
tively . 0.3%, 0.3% and 0.4% bitrate reduction for luma , 
chroma Cb and Cr are obtained under the C 2 condition re ⁃
spectively . In terms of computational complexity , the encod ⁃
ing time increases by 6% while the decoding time increases 
by 10%.
To further evaluate the prediction effect of the proposed 
optimization scheme , we also count the errors during the 
transform domain prediction stage . Specifically , for each se ⁃
quence in Cat 1, prediction errors of all slices are accumu ⁃
lated if the upsampled prediction is enabled . As illustrated 
in Fig . 6, the average prediction errors of each type of point 
cloud are all smaller than that of the original prediction 
scheme in TMC 13-v22.0. Therefore , our proposed method 
can effectively improve compression efficiency by reducing 
prediction errors .
5 Conclusions
In this paper , a subnode -based prediction is proposed to im ⁃
prove the lossy point cloud attribute compression for the 
MPEG G -PCC platform . Based on the original upsampled 
transform domain prediction scheme , we leverage some 
already -encoded neighbor nodes at the same level as the cur ⁃
rent node to be encoded to optimize the original prediction
