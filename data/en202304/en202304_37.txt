where the octree and RAHT configuration are applied for ge ⁃
ometry and attribute respectively . In terms of the test condi ⁃
tions , as shown in Table 1, C1 (i.e., lossless geometry lossy at ⁃
tributes ) and C 2 conditions (i.e., near -lossless/lossy geometry lossy attributes ) are both evalu ⁃
ated on the reference software 
TMC 13-v22.0 and GeS -TM -v2.0.
4.1 Datasets
The test datasets provided by 
MPEG G -PCC can be mainly clas ⁃
sified into three categories : Cat ⁃
egory 1—Static Objects and 
Scenes datasets (i.e., Cat1), Cat⁃
egory 2—Dynamic Objects datas ⁃
ets (i.e., Cat2), and Category 3—
Dynamic Acquisition datasets (i.
e., Cat 3). Specifically , sequences 
in Cat 1 are further divided based 
on the density and surface conti ⁃
nuity of point clouds (i.e., Solid , 
Dense , Sparse , and Scant ). For 
Cat2, test classes A , B and C indi ⁃
cate the complexity of point 
clouds , where A is the lowest and 
C is the highest . The division of 
Cat3 is more detailed , including 
automotive frame -based data ac ⁃
quired by spinning and non -
spinning LiDAR sensors (i.e., Am -
frame ) and automotive LiDAR ac ⁃
quired data after fused and reprocessed (i.e., Am -fused ). Note 
that Am -fused datasets have both color and reflectance attri ⁃
butes . In terms of the CTCs , the Cat 1 and Cat 3 datasets are 
tested on TMC 13v22.0 while the Cat 2 datasets are tested on 
GeS -TMv2.0. All test sequences mentioned above are avail ⁃
able in the MPEG content repository[31].
4.2 Performance Evaluations
The attribute compression performances compared with 
TMC 13-v22.0 are shown in Table 2, where the negative Bjon ⁃
tegaard delta (BD) rate illustrates the coding gains against the 
anchor . From Table 2, it can be seen that consistent coding
