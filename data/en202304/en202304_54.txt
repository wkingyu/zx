3 Experimental Results
3.1 Point Cloud Sequence Selection
We use ten static point clouds to examine the performance 
of the proposed method in terms of objective and perceptual 
quality . Fig. 3 shows a thumbnail of the point cloud se ⁃
quences . Table 1 shows the detailed information of each point 
cloud sequence .
3.2 Subjective and Objective Results
The effect of the rendering through outlier detection is first 
evaluated by conducting a subjective comparison before and 
after outlier optimization . Take Head ’s character point cloud 
sequence and Phil ’s object point cloud sequence as ex ⁃
amples . Figs . 4 and 5 show the subjective comparison effects 
of the above two point cloud sequences using the original 
point -rendering[10] and the proposed method . It can be found 
that the rendering radius of outlier points far from the main se ⁃
quence area is significantly reduced after outlier detection 
and rendering , and the perceptual quality of the point cloud 
sequence is improved .
We also compress the original point cloud sequence and 
calculate the PSNR using the original point rendering[10] and 
the proposed method . The improvement of PSNR using the 
proposed method is utilized to react to the effectiveness of ren ⁃
dering based on outlier detection .
In terms of point cloud compression , since outlier point de ⁃
tection does not target the attribute features of the point cloud 
sequence , the original color attributes are not compressed , and 
the original point cloud sequence attributes are kept lossless . 
Regarding geometric compression , we choose three geometric 
quantization parameters with large discretization , namely {1/10, 
1/2, 15/18}, to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm 
under different degrees of geometric compression in geometry 
point cloud compression (G-PCC).
To compute PSNR , we project each point cloud sequence to 
the three planes of the point cloud enclosing the box to form 
three views of the point cloud view . We render the original un ⁃
compressed sequence of the point cloud sequence through Pc ⁃
cAppRendererV 6.0 with the rendering radius set to 1.0 to ob ⁃
tain the reference view of the point cloud sequence . The quan ⁃
tized distortion images of each point cloud sequence before 
and after optimization are obtained in turn , and the mean 
squared error (MSE ) and PSNR are calculated from the refer ⁃
ence image and distortion image as shown in the following 
equations .
