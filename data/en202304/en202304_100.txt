that the decrease of MOS with the frame rate is independent of 
the QP . This observation follows the conclusions drawn in 
Refs. [44] and [45] and confirms our hypothesis . The trend in 
Fig. 5 can be fitted using the function as
TCF(Fr)=v1⋅exp(v2⋅f)+v3 , (4)
where v1, v2, and v3 are −1.672, −0.095 31 and 1.112, respec ⁃
tively , which were obtained by regression .
4.1.2 Spatial Quality Factor
In this subsection , we investigate and modeled the spatial 
quality , which is mainly influenced by the bitrate , video reso ⁃
lution , and screen resolution . Fig. 6 shows the relationship be ⁃
tween the BPP and the perceptual video quality of four 360 -
degree videos . It can be seen that the perceptual video quality 
increases with the rise of BPP . However , as for videos at differ ⁃
ent resolutions , the increasing trends of the perceptual video 
quality are different . This trend can be represented as
SQF(BPP)=v4⋅ln(v5⋅BPP⋅1 000+1) , (5)
