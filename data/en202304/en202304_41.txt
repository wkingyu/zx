1 Introduction
3D object detection is critical for applications such as au ⁃
tonomous driving , robotic system navigation , and auto ⁃
mation systems . The goal of 3D object detection is to lo ⁃
cate and identify objects in 3D scenes . Specifically , its 
purpose is to estimate oriented 3D bounding boxes and seman ⁃
tic categories of objects from point cloud data and provide im ⁃
portant information for subsequent analysis and processing . 
3D point cloud object detection is a challenging task . Here are 
some major difficulties :
1) Occlusion : In complex scenes , target objects may be oc ⁃
cluded by other objects , which affects the performance of de ⁃
tection algorithms .
2) Sparsity : Due to the working principle of light detection 
and ranging (LiDAR ), point cloud data are usually sparse , 
which means that there are fewer effective points on the target 
object .
3) Point cloud noise : Noise points may be generated during 
the LiDAR scanning process , which will interfere with the per ⁃
formance of the detection algorithm .
4) Real -time requirements : 3D point cloud object detection usually needs to be completed in real time .
The object detection algorithm is a computer vision technol ⁃
ogy that can identify and locate specific objects in images or 
point clouds and is divided into 2D object detection[1–3] and 
3D object detection[4–8]. These algorithms typically use deep 
learning techniques . Object detection includes tasks such as 
classification , localization , detection , and segmentation . Clas ⁃
sification refers to obtaining what type of object is included in 
the image or point cloud data . Localization refers to the posi ⁃
tion of the given object . Detection refers to locating the posi ⁃
tion of an object and judging the category of the object . Seg⁃
mentation refers to determining which object or scene each 
point or each pixel belongs to . Object detection algorithms are 
widely used in many fields , such as face recognition , auto ⁃
matic driving , and industrial inspection . For example , in face 
recognition , object detection algorithms can be used to auto ⁃
matically detect and track human faces and recognize the de ⁃
tected faces . Unmanned driving applications rely on object de ⁃
tection algorithms to give the poses of other traffic participants 
to deal with complex road conditions .
