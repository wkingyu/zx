360 -degree video can be assessed based on the corresponding 
technical parameters extracted from the VR system .
5 Performance Evaluation
The performance of the proposed model was evaluated on a 
test set consisting of another four YUV 420 360 -degree video 
sequences that had a video resolution of 3 840×1 920 and a 
video framerate of 30 fps. Screenshots of the video content are 
shown in Fig . 15. Four lossless audio files (PCM , 48 kHz ) con⁃
taining two channels were utilized as the background sound of 
these 360 -degree videos . The 360 -degree videos were firstly 
down -sampled to 2K resolution and encoded with a BPP of 
0.02, 0.06, 0.14, and 0.19 using the x .265 encoder . The audio 
files were encoded with 16 kbit/s , 64 kbit/s , 128 kbit/s , and 
256 kbit/s using the AAC codec . We conducted two experi ⁃
ments to verify the performance of the proposed model by 
changing the video bitrate , audio bitrate , and MTP latency . In 
the first experiment , audiovisual files were displayed without 
MTP latency . The display FOV was set to be 90 degrees and 
110 degrees , respectively . The details of the setting are shown 
in Table 5. In the second experiment , audiovisual files with 
4K resolution were displayed with three MTP latencies , i.e., 
40 ms, 120 ms, and 260 ms, respectively . The display FOV 
was set to be 110 degrees . The details of the setting are shown 
in Table 6. A total number of 30 subjects participated in these two experiments . After each display , the subjects provided 
their ratings on the spatial presence on a five -point scale .
Since there is no model evaluating the spatial presence that 
can be used as a comparison , we only show the performance of 
the proposed model . The performance is evaluated in two 
ways : 1) comparing predicted scores of the spatial presence 
with the subjective MOS , and 2) comparing the predicted 
scores with the subjective scores rated by individuals .
5.1 Predicted Scores vs MOS
Three commonly used performance criteria are employed to 
measure the performance of the proposed model : Pearson Cor ⁃
relation Coefficient (PCC), Root -Mean -Squared Error (RMSE ), 
and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient (SROCC ).
The model performance is given in Table 7. It can be found 
that reliable prediction performance is obtained when using 
the proposed spatial presence evaluation model .
