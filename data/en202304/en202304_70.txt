ally falls toward the front of the direction of motion , there is a 
certain similarity with the action of bending down to pick up , 
while the sit -down -fall situation is easily confused with sitting 
down and therefore easily to miss .
6) Comparison of network sizes for different deep models . 
We compare the scale of various deep networks , and the re ⁃
sults of the comparison are shown in  Fig. 14. In the case of dif ⁃
ferent features , the corresponding network models are smaller 
in size because the DWT spectrum has fewer orders of fea ⁃
tures compared with the original CSI magnitude information 
and the STFT spectrum . From the results , the scale of the 
model corresponding to using the DWT spectrum as features 
is one order of magnitude less than the other two features . For 
the different classification models , the CNN model has fewer 
parameters than the LSTM model with the same size input , so 
the network size is smaller . Overall , our system achieves bet ⁃
ter performance by using a network model as small as possible .
7) System latency analysis . To validate the efficiency of 
our system , we deployed it on a laptop with an 8-core Intel 
i7-6700  @2.60 GHz CPU and measured the system ’s run ⁃
time. The system ’s runtime is mainly composed of feature 
extraction and model classification . Experimental results 
show that using 2 s of CSI information as input , the overall 
average end -to-end runtime is 18.1 ms, with feature extrac ⁃
tion taking 7.5 ms and model classification taking 10.6 ms. The results indicate that our system can achieve real -time 
detection of fall actions .
4 Conclusions
In our work , a passive fall detection system based on Wi -Fi 
is proposed . To better obtain information about the motion 
state of the target , this work extracts the DWT spectrum from 
the received raw signal to characterize the user ’s activity . To 
achieve better classification results , this work designs a classi ⁃
fier based on a deep learning model for fall detection . The ex ⁃
perimental evaluation illustrates that our work achieves false 
alarm and missed alarm rates of 4.8% and 1.9%, with better 
performance than other existing works and systems .
