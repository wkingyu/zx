poses challenges , as indiscriminate removal of points might 
compromise fine details and key features , which could affect 
downstream applications like object recognition or surface re ⁃
construction .
4) Compression . Point cloud compression is a vital area of 
research that aims to reduce the storage and transmission re ⁃
quirements of 3D point cloud data while preserving its essen ⁃
tial geometric and semantic properties . One prominent ap ⁃
proach to point cloud compression is the development of the 
video -based point cloud compression (VPCC ) standard , which 
leverages the coding efficiency of video compression tech ⁃
niques adapted to the point cloud domain . VPCC efficiently 
represents point clouds by exploiting temporal redundancies 
and inter -frame dependencies , enabling high compression ra ⁃
tios while maintaining visual quality and accuracy . Another 
significant advancement in point cloud compression is the 
geometry -based point cloud compression (GPCC ) standard . 
GPCC focuses on the efficient compression of point cloud ge ⁃
ometry , utilizing various techniques like octree -based coding , 
predictive coding , and attribute coding . By considering the 
geometric properties of point clouds , GPCC achieves superior 
compression performance while facilitating fast and reliable 
decompression for real -time applications . VPCC and GPCC 
play a key role in optimizing the storage and delivery of mas ⁃
sive point cloud databases , making them more accessible and 
usable in a variety of applications such as virtual reality , aug⁃
mented reality , and cloud -based services . However , at the 
same time , point cloud compression inevitably leads to degra ⁃
dation of point cloud quality .
2.2 Common Subjective Experimental Setups
Presenting point cloud content is essential to harness the 
valuable information it contains . As a versatile data format , 
point clouds can be visualized using various methods . Tradi ⁃
tional 2D monitors allow for a flat , easily accessible represen ⁃
tation of point clouds , enabling researchers and users to ex ⁃
plore the data from different angles . On the other hand , 3D 
monitors provide a more immersive experience , allowing a 
deeper understanding of the spatial relationships among the 
points . Furthermore , head -mounted devices (HMDs ), such as 
virtual reality (VR) headsets , take the presentation of point 
clouds to another level , offering an unparalleled sense of pres ⁃
ence and interaction with the 3D data . The summary of exist ⁃
ing point cloud subjective evaluation works is presented in 
Table 1, with significant differences in interaction methods , 
viewing displays , scoring methods , and more . There are three 
prevalent scoring methodologies employed in the assessment 
of perceptual quality : the Double -Stimulus Impairment Scale 
(DSIS ), Absolute Category Rating (ACR ), and Pairwise Com ⁃
parison (PWC ). In DSIS , evaluators are presented with a refer ⁃
ence point cloud and a distorted point cloud , with the task of 
rating the quality of the distorted point cloud . Conversely , in 
ACR , evaluators are tasked with categorizing each distorted point cloud into predefined quality categories , such as “excel ⁃
lent,” “good,” “fair,” or “poor.” In the case of PWC , evalua ⁃
tors are presented with pairs of distorted point clouds and are 
required to indicate which of the two exhibits superior quality . ▼Table 1. Summary of the experimental setups for subjective cloud
