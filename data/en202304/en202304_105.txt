To visualize the performance , Fig. 16 shows the scatter 
plots of objective scores predicted by the proposed model 
against the subjective MOSs . This figure clearly shows that 
the proposed model exhibits good convergence and monotonic ⁃
ity performance .
5.2 Predicted Scores vs Individual Ratings
To also check the accuracy of the proposed model , we 
evaluated the performance of the model against the indi ⁃
vidual ratings of subjects . Again , PCC , SROCC , and RMSE 
were calculated . For Experiment 1, we found that the PCC , 
SROCC , and RMSE ranged from 0.882 to 0.926, 0.878 to 
0.922, and 0.443 to 0.227, respectively . For Experiment 2, 
we found that the PCC , SROCC , and RMSE ranged between 
0.886 to 0.924, 0.881 to 0.918, and 0.462 to 0.214. Among 
the 30 subjects , the lowest , medium and highest prediction 
results are shown in Table 8. It can be found that a relatively 
good prediction performance is always guaranteed using the 
proposed model .
We also calculated the percentage that the predicted scores 
match the subjective scores to better verify the accuracy of the 
proposed model . A match is found if a predicted score (after 
the rounding process ) is the same as the subjective score rated 
by the participants . The results show that the proposed model 
matches the subjective ratings with an accuracy of 83.7% and 
82.4% for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively . It can be con ⁃
cluded that the proposed model manifests itself as a reliable 
spatial presence indicator that can be directly used in current 
360 -degree video applications .
6 Conclusions
In this paper , we propose a spatial presence assessment 
framework for measuring users ’ sense of spatial presence in 
360 -degree video services . Well -designed subjective experi ⁃
ments are conducted to obtain accurate subjective ratings of 
spatial presence . An objective spatial presence prediction 
model is further proposed . Experimental results show that the 
proposed model can achieve good prediction accuracy in 
terms of PCC , SROCC , and RMSE . The proposed scheme 
serves as guidelines for the research community to better un ⁃
derstand the spatial presence perception . It also provides valu ⁃
able recommendations for the industry to further improve its 
quality of service .References
