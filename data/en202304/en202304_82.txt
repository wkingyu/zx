crease the number of levels and reduce d v/dt in this paper . 
Otherwise , if the 5L-ANPC topology is adopted for both upper 
and lower bridge arms , 16 switches are required . The number 
of switches is too large to meet the requirements of high power 
density . This paper presents a hybrid rectifier topology by 
combining the upper bridge arm 5L-ANPC and lower bridge 
arm diodes .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . In Section 2, 
the operating characteristics and the control strategy of the 5L-
ANPC hybrid rectifier are introduced , including FC voltage 
regulation . In Section 3, simulations and experiments verify 
the effectiveness and performance of the strategy proposed in 
Section 2. Finally , the conclusion is given in Section 4.
2 Working Principle
2.1 Topology Analysis
A traditional multilevel topology is difficult to apply in five 
or higher levels because of the inability to control the point 
voltage in the bus bar and the excessive number of clamping 
elements . The 5L-ANPC has aroused wide concern after it was 
proposed . It can improve the output voltage level , using fewer 
devices when outputting the same number of levels , and its ca ⁃
pacitor voltage equalizing control algorithm is relatively 
simple , which has great application potential in switching 
power supply .
The AC/DC rectifier circuit needs to realize power factor 
correction and suppress common -mode current . More levels 
can be achieved through the combination of upper and lower 
bridge arms , but it conflicts with the demand for high power 
density . Therefore , the topological structure of five levels on 
the upper arm and the diode on the lower arm is adopted , as 
shown in Fig . 1.
The upper bridge arm is a single -phase 5L ANPC converter 
topology , consisting of 8 switches with inverse shunt diodes , 
an FC Cf , and two supporting capacitors C1 and C2 on the DC 
side. The first part consists of two supporting capacitors and four switching devices , which are used to clamp the busbar 
voltage . The latter part uses the FC structure for multilevel 
output . Assuming that the voltage at the DC side is 4E, the 
conditions for the topology to work properly are as follows . 1) 
The voltage of the two support capacitors at the DC side is 
basically the same , that is , UC1= UC2 = Udc/2 = 2E. 2) The volt ⁃
age of the flying span capacitor is ensured to be basically 
stable , i.e., UCf = Udc/4 = E.
The corresponding switching devices of 5L ANPC converter 
topology are complementary , and their actions must follow the 
following switching principles[8]: 1) The switching devices 
S1 and S3, S2 and S4 must be turned on or off at the same time , 
respectively . The two groups are complementary and operate 
at power frequency ; 2) The switching devices S5 and S7, S6 and 
S8 should be complementary respectively and operate at the 
switching frequency ; 3) When switching mode of switches is 
selected , two pairs of switch devices operating at the same 
time is usually avoided .
The positive direction of the output current io of the con ⁃
verter bridge arm and the FC current if are denoted in Fig . 2. 
All switching states and their related currents can be obtained 
in Table 1. It can be seen that there are eight different switch ⁃
ing states from V1 to V8, and the rectifier can produce five volt ⁃
