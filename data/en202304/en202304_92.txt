the right . From Table 4, it can be found that when EC in⁃
creases , the TZ is shifted to the left . From Tables 3 and 4, we 
can also see that when the TZ is located in the lower stopband , 
EC is stronger than MC. If the TZ is in the upper stopband , 
then MC is stronger than EC.
To conclude , the tuning of the mixed electric and magnetic 
coupling structure in Fig . 3(a) follows two rules :
Rule 1: We simultaneously increase or decrease EC and MC 
to tune Cij.
Rule 2: If the TZ is in the lower stopband , we can increase 
EC and decrease MC to increase Mij. If the TZ is in the upper 
stopband , we can increase MC and decrease EC simultaneously 
to increase Mij.
To verify the above theory , take a 7th-order filter with the 
coupling topology shown in Fig . 4(a) as an example . The cen ⁃
ter frequency and bandwidth of the filter are 3.5 GHz and 
200 MHz , respectively . The in -band return loss level is re ⁃
quired to be 18 dB. Two TZs at 3.7 GHz and 3.3 GHz are 
generated sequentially by two mainline FDCs . The synthe ⁃
sized coupling matrix and capacitance matrix are shown in 
Figs. 5 and 6, respectively .
The perspective view of the filter model is shown in Fig . 4(b). 
With the help of the MVF method to extract the coupling matrix 
from simulation data , we can identify how to adjust the dimen ⁃
sions and finally obtain satisfactory filter responses . The simula ⁃
tion results with ideal lossless materials are shown in  Fig. 7, 
where solid lines are simulation data , and dashed lines are the ideal synthesis responses .
4 Conclusions
In this paper , the relationship between the coupling matrix 
(capacitance matrix ) and EC (MC) is obtained through circuit 
analysis . A filter example is designed to verify the proposed 
theory . Although only the inline filter is discussed in detail , 
the strategy introduced in this paper can be easily generalized 
to mixed electric and magnetic coupling filters in different 
coupling topologies . Compared with the existing theory of 
mixed electric and magnetic coupling filters , this work has the 
following distinctive features .
