precision . Experimental results showcase its superior perfor ⁃
mance over existing MPEG standards .
The fourth paper titled “Point Cloud Processing Methods 
for 3D Point Cloud Detection Tasks ” revolves around the piv ⁃
otal role of 3D point cloud processing in object detection . 
Given the complexity of data acquired from LiDAR sensors , 
the paper offers a review of point cloud processing methods 
and how they influence detection outcomes . The discussion 
underscores the evolution of voxelization and sampling strate ⁃
gies, emphasizing their implications for feature extraction and 
final detection performance .
The fifth paper titled “Perceptual Optimization for Point -
Based Point Cloud Rendering ” delves into the challenges in 
point -based rendering for point clouds . The established 
method of determining rendering radius using neighboring 
points' distances is problematic . The paper introduces an out ⁃
lier detection mechanism that optimizes the perceptual quality 
of rendering , using local and global geometric features to de ⁃
tect outliers . Results confirm the significant improvements in 
rendering quality with this approach .
The sixth paper titled “Local Scenario Perception and Web 
AR Navigation ” explores the exciting convergence of web 
technologies and augmented reality (Web AR ). As Web AR 
grapples with computational demands , the paper introduces 
an indoor navigation system based on local point cloud map 
positioning . This novel approach minimizes the need for exter ⁃
nal sensors , highlighting a promising avenue for precise and 
widespread application of Web AR navigation .
To conclude , this special issue aims to be an indispensable 
guide for researchers , industry experts , and students delving 
into 3D point cloud processing and its varied applications . We 
anticipate that the content will spur more research and ad ⁃
vancements , shaping the future trajectory of digital spatial 
data analysis . Our deepest gratitude extends to all the authors , 
reviewers , and editorial staff for their invaluable contributions 
that have made this issue a success . We earnestly hope that 
the articles in this special issue offer both clarity and insight 
to all readers in this emerging domain .
