3D point cloud processing has redefined the way we per ⁃
ceive and interact with digital spatial data . By translat ⁃
ing physical entities into a collection of 3D points , it of ⁃
fers an accurate digital model of our surroundings . This 
emerging field of 3D point -based representation has piqued in ⁃
terest significantly over recent years , owing to its capacity to 
depict detailed spatial environments , thereby bridging the gap 
between virtual and real dimensions . Numerous applications , 
including virtual reality , augmented reality , and advanced 
mapping , have greatly benefited from this technology , allowing 
for immersive experiences and accurate spatial analysis . How ⁃
ever, the journey from raw spatial data to refined point cloud 
representations is fraught with challenges , including storage 
and computational demands , noise handling and the quest for 
efficient compression techniques .
In this special issue on 3D point cloud processing and ap ⁃
plications , we present a curated series of articles that dive 
deep into these challenges , suggesting innovative strategies 
and methodologies tailored to address them . The selected con ⁃
tributions touch upon a diverse spectrum of topics within the 
realm of point cloud processing . They discuss novel compres ⁃
sion algorithms , delve into quality assessment metrics , eluci ⁃
date advanced rendering techniques , and highlight the nu ⁃
ances of feature extraction , among other pivotal areas . The call 
for papers for this special issue attracted excellent submis ⁃sions , indicating the growing significance of this field . Follow ⁃
ing rigorous reviews , we are proud to present six standout pa ⁃
pers that not only showcase cutting -edge research but also set 
the direction for future endeavors in this domain .
The first paper titled “Perceptual Quality Assessment for 
Point Clouds : A Survey ” delivers a comprehensive overview of 
how the visual quality of point clouds is gauged . Traditional 
quality assessment methods fall short when applied to point 
cloud data . This survey presents the significance of point 
cloud quality assessment , discussing common distortions , ex⁃
perimental setups , and subjective databases . It contrasts 
model -based and projection -based objective methods , and the 
performance of these methods across various databases is ana ⁃
lyzed . Experimental insights underline the utility and efficacy 
of the presented methods .
The second paper titled “Spatio -Temporal Context -Guided 
Algorithm for Lossless Point Cloud Geometry Compression ” 
addresses the challenges faced during the compression of 
point cloud data . Traditional compression techniques struggle 
with the irregular distribution of point cloud data in space and 
time. This paper introduces an innovative context -guided algo ⁃
rithm that slices point clouds and employs the travelling sales ⁃
man algorithm to predict compression . Testing results empha ⁃
size its robustness , presenting a feasible avenue for efficient 
3D point cloud compression (PCC).
The third paper titled “Lossy Point Cloud Attribute Com ⁃
pression with Subnode -Based Prediction ” shines light on the 
advances in 3D point cloud compression . With the Moving 
Picture Expert Group (MPEG ) working towards a standard for 
PCC, the paper highlights the challenges in current attribute 
compression techniques . It introduces a subnode -based pre ⁃
diction method , leveraging spatial relationships for improved 七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七七
