2 Subjective Point Cloud Quality Assessment
This chapter delves into the assessment of human percep ⁃
tion of point clouds with the aim of understanding how users 
subjectively perceive the quality of these 3D data representa ⁃
tions . The chapter begins by describing various common 
types of point cloud distortion that may affect human percep ⁃
tion. By shedding light on these distortions , the chapter high ⁃
lights the importance of addressing these issues to improve 
the overall quality of point cloud visualization and ensure a 
more accurate user experience . An introduction to existing 
point cloud databases follows the discussion of point cloud 
distortion . This section focuses on databases curated specifi ⁃
cally for subjective quality assessment purposes . The signifi ⁃
cance of such databases lies in their ability to provide re ⁃
searchers with carefully controlled test cases that allow for 
the systematic study of human perception at different levels 
of distortion .
2.1 Common Types of Distortion in Point Clouds
As the point cloud distortion modeled in LS -PCQA[4] (a 
large -scale PCQA dataset ) by LIU et al ., point clouds are not 
only subjected to various degrees of noise , compression , and 
sampling , but even localized distortions such as loss , rotation , 
and Audio Video Coding Standard (AVS) during the actual 
generation and communication transmission process . We se ⁃
lect four most common types of point cloud distortion to intro ⁃
duce , including color noise , geometric noise , downsampling and point cloud compression . The visual effects of the various 
distortions are shown in Fig . 2.
1) Color noise . Point cloud color noise is defined as un ⁃
wanted variations and inaccuracies in the color information as ⁃
sociated with individual points in a 3D point cloud . When ac ⁃
quiring point cloud data from various sources such as 3D scan ⁃
ners and LiDAR systems , color information is typically cap ⁃
tured along with the 3D coordinates of each point . However , 
due to factors such as sensor noise , lighting conditions , and 
calibration errors , the color values assigned to the points may 
deviate from the true color of the corresponding object or sur ⁃
face in the real world . This may result in an inconsistent vi ⁃
sual appearance of the point cloud and affect subsequent ap ⁃
plications that rely on accurate color information .
2) Geometry noise . Point cloud geometry noise is the inher ⁃
ent irregularities and inaccuracies in the spatial coordinates of 
individual points in a 3D point cloud . These inaccuracies can 
arise from a variety of causes , including sensor limitations , 
measurement errors , calibration issues and occlusions during 
data acquisition . As a result , the point cloud may contain 
shifted or misaligned points , resulting in reduced geometric 
accuracy and fidelity . Geometry noise can adversely affect the 
quality of the 3D model derived from the point cloud as well 
as subsequent tasks .
3) Downsampling . Point cloud downsampling is a key tech ⁃
nique used to reduce the data size of 3D point clouds while 
preserving the underlying structural and spatial information . 
Large -scale point clouds acquired from 3D scanning or Li ⁃
DAR systems may contain millions or billions of points , and 
processing and storing these points require extensive computa ⁃
tion. Downsampling involves the systematic removal of a sub ⁃
set of points from the original data , thereby effectively simpli ⁃
fying its representation without significantly affecting its over ⁃
all shape and characteristics . However , downsampling also
