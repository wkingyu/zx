via Eq . (15).
Lemma 1: When the scale of the c -subarray is large and 
tends towards infinity , but the distance between the transmit ⁃
ter and the XL -HRIS is finite , the CRLB of the pseudo -true 
parameter estimate will tends towards 0, while the value of LB 
mainly depends on the channel model mismatch and tends to ⁃
wards a non -zero constant value , which can be expressed as
LBNsub→∞(θ)=9d2( ) 1-2θ2+θ4
2r2 . (32)
Lemma 2: If the distance between the UE and the XL -
HRIS i s infinite , the variation caused by the channel model 
mismatch will tend towards 0, and the value of LB tends to ⁃
wards the CRLB of the pseudo -true parameter estimate , i.e., 
LBr→∞(θ)=CRLB(θpse).
Lemma 3: With the increase of the transmit power , the LB 
tends towards a constant value , which can be expressed as
LBP(θ)=(1+3Nsub+4

2r2. (33)
Note that the CRLB of the estimated pseudo -true parameter 
is inversely proportional to the SNR , while the variation 
caused by the channel model mismatch is independent of the 
SNR. Hence , with the transmit power increasing to infinity , 
the CRLB of the estimated pseudo -true parameter will tend to ⁃
wards 0, and the AoA parameter estimation accuracy is 
mainly limited by the channel model mismatch .
3.3 Impacts of Channel Model Mismatch and Array 
Scale on SE
To reduce computational complexity in the proposed XL -
HRIS -aided system , the AoA parameter is estimated by the c -
subarray , and then the distance parameter is detected through 
the receive signal of the r -subarray . Finally , the complex gain 
can be calculated through the least square (LS) method . By es ⁃
timating the two separate channels between the UE/BS and 
the XL -HRIS , the cascade channel from the UE to the BS can 
be reconstructed accurately . The impacts of the c -subarray’s 
scale on the SE are studied as follows .
When the XL -HRIS is in the passive mode , the BS receives 
the signal reflected by the XL -HRIS , which can be denoted as
yBS=PwH
recHBSΩhR+nBS, (34)
where HBS∈CM×N denotes the channel between the XL -HRIS 
and the BS ; nBS∈CM×1 is the additional Gaussian white noise 
with 0 mean and σ2 variance ; Ω=diag(ejφ1,⋯, ejφN) is the 
phase shift matrix of the XL -HRIS ; φn follows the random dis ⁃
tribution within )[0, 2π, for n=1,⋯, N; wrec∈CM×1 denotes 
the beamforming vector . If the perfect CSI has been ob ⁃tained[35–36], and the maximal ratio combining (MRC ) receiver 
is adopted , i.e., wrec=HBSΩhR
 HBSΩhR. Hence , the SE with the per ⁃
fect CSI can be calculated as
C=E{log2(1+SNRrec)}, (35)
where the received SNR at the BS is defined as
SNRrec=P HBSΩhR2
σ2 . (36)
Nevertheless , the perfect CSI cannot be obtained in ad ⁃
vance in the real communication system , and the CSI should 
be estimated through a channel estimation algorithm , which 
can lead to errors in the estimated channel parameters and a 
decrease in the SE . Considering a stable environment between 
the XL -HRIS and the BS , we assume that the perfect CSI of 
HBS has been obtained . Hence , only the impacts of the esti ⁃
mated parameters ’ errors in the channel between the UE and 
the XL -HRIS on the SE performance should be analyzed . To 
calculate the maximum SE when the estimation error exists 
(which will decrease the SE ) in the proposed system , the mini ⁃
mum errors of the estimates are assumed as {Δθmin, Δrmin}=
{LB(θ), CRLB(r)}, where CRLB(r) can be calculated as
CRLB(r)=2P||g2

The detailed expression of CRLB(r) can be seen in Ref . 
[32]. Typically , a special scenario is considered , i.e., θ=1, 
and the receive signal is rewritten as
y=g͂[ejkcr1,…, ejkcrN]T
, (38)
where g͂=gre-jkcr. Then , we have rn=|r-χnd|, and the 
CRLB(r) can be denoted as
CRLB(r)=∑n∈Θ2P||g2

(39)
where Θ denotes the vector constructed by the index of the el ⁃
ements in the c -subarray and the r -subarray . Meanwhile , in 
the special scenario θ=1, the estimation accuracy lower 
bound of the realistic parameter LB(θ) is equal to that of the 
pseudo -true parameter CRLB(θpse), which can be expressed as
LB(θ)=CRLB(θpse)=6σ2
