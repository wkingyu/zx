the Rayleigh fading channel , we generate 100 sets of F and 
calculate the corresponding channel matrices for each 
scene . The singular values are an average of 100 random 
channel matrices .
First, we study the DOF of a ULA system and a UPA system 
with λ/2 spacing and 200λ distance as a benchmark . In this 
scenario , the ULA system and the UPA system are weak cou ⁃
pling arrays in the far field . The DOF distribution is shown in 
Fig. 4(a) for a far -field channel as well as a near -field channel 
at the distance of 10λ. Additionally , simulations considering 
the mutual coupling are shown in Fig . 4(b) for λ/4 spacing 
with the same antenna configuration .
In Fig . 4(a), it can be seen that the ULA and UPA have 
similar singular value distributions in both the far -field and 
the near -field. Furthermore , the singular values for the simu ⁃
lated near -field channel are much bigger than those of the far-field channel . This can be clearly interpreted as a gain of 
the path loss . Since Dfarfield=20Dnearfield, the singular values 
should decrease by a factor of 400 in the far -field, which is 
exactly the inverse -square law . The simulations in Fig . 4(b) 
supports this similarity in modest mutual coupling . Also , the 
rich scattering channel greatly increases the available DOF 
of the system , thereby improving spatial multiplexing and 
channel performance .
Second , we study the influence of planting more antennas 
into an array with a fixed aperture to the channel matrix . Spe⁃
cifically , we analyze eight antenna configurations with a fixed 
7.5λ ULA and 1.5λ×1.5λ UPA aperture listed in Table 1 
with indexes 5–8 and 13–16. 
Fig. 5 shows that the ULA and UPA share similar singular 
values in the near - and far -fields of a dense array configura ⁃
tion and the near field of a super -dense array configuration .

and 16×16 antennas UPA , and antenna spacing is λ/10. See Table 1 for
