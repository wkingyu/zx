lower than −17.5 dB and insertion loss of lower than 11.56 dB 
for all the four modes . Based on the TRC -FMF and all -fiber 
MMUX/MDEMUX , a real -time 4-mode 3-λ 25 km MDM -
WDM transmission is experimentally demonstrated using com ⁃
mercial 400G OTN transceivers , which proves the smooth up ⁃
grade of high -speed coherent transmission scenarios is pos ⁃
sible by using weakly -coupled MDM techniques .
