where neff of the LP01 mode of the customized SMF is 1.453 at 
1 550 nm. And a standard SMF with a core/cladding radius of 
4.1/62.5 μm and Δn of 0.36% at 1 550 nm is adopted to phase -
matching with LP21 and LP02 modes of the TRC -FMF .
To satisfy the phase -matching condition , FMFs or SMFs are 
firstly pre -tapered on a fused biconical taper station . Fig. 3 
shows neff of the four LP modes in the TRC -FMF and LP01 
modes in the customized SMF and standard SMF as functions 
of the tapered radius , which are calculated by COMSOL multi ⁃
physics and Matlab based on the fabricated index profiles . The 
cross points of the dotted lines indicate the proper tapering ra ⁃
dii for fabricating each MSC . We can see that the radius of the 
customized SMF needs to be pre -tapered to 58.5/49.2 μm re⁃
spectively for the LP01 and LP11 MSCs , while the radius of the 
FMF is supposed to be pre -tapered to 57 μm for the LP21 
MSC . For phase -matching with LP02 modes , the radius of the 
standard SMF should be pre -tapered to 49 μm. Then the 
FMFs and SMFs are respectively embedded into quartz blocks 
and polished on the grinding platform (SW -22C, SAMWELL ). 
After polishing , the two half couplers are mated together to 
form the MSC .
The LP01, LP11, LP21 and LP02 MSCs are then cascaded or ⁃
derly by fusion splicing to form a 4-mode MMUX , and the 
LP02, LP21, LP11 and LP01 MSCs are cascaded orderly by fusion 
splicing to form the 4-mode DEMMUX , which is shown in Fig . 
4(a). It should be noted that since a single MSC can only de ⁃
multiplex one spatial component of each pair of degenerate 
modes , a mode rotator is utilized before demultiplexing each 
degenerate mode to change its spatial orientation and achieve 
efficient demultiplexing . The output mode fields of the MMUX 
is presented in Fig . 4(b) and Table 2 shows IL and the modal 
crosstalk matrix of a pair of MMUX/MDEMUX and 25 km 
weakly -coupled TRC -FMF . We can find that the maximum IL 
of the 25 km MDM link is 11.56 dB (LP21 mode ) and the larg ⁃
est relative modal crosstalk , which is defined as the power ra ⁃tio between the crosstalk and signal for any two LP modes , is 
−17.5 dB (for the case of LP01 input and LP02 output ).
3 Experimental Setup and Results
3.1 Experimental Setup
Real -time MDM -WDM transmission utilizing commercial 
400G OTN transceivers and all -fiber side -polishing MMUX/
MDEMUX was experimentally conducted with the experimen ⁃
tal setup shown in Fig . 5. The 400G OTN transceivers used 
dual -polarization (DP) 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation 
(QAM ) with a baud rate of 69 Gbit/s (27% overhead ). Twelve 
sets of 400G transceivers were configured with three wave ⁃
lengths for each LP mode . The three central wavelengths for 
each mode were chosen to be 1 529.528 nm, 1 550.892 nm 
and 1 564.649 nm to evaluate the characteristics of our trans ⁃
mission system over the C -band respectively . At the transmit ⁃
ter, four wavelength -selective switches (WSS ) are utilized as 
wavelength multiplexers (WMUX ) for each LP mode . Four 
Erbium -doped fiber amplifiers (EDFA ) are followed to adjust 
the input power for balancing the span loss of the four LP 
modes in the MDM link . Then the wavelength -multiplexed sig ⁃
nals are multiplexed by the 4-mode MMUX . After 25 km ▼Table 2. IL and modal crosstalk matrix of 25 km MDM link at 1 550 nm
