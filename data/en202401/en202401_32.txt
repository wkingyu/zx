Due to the non -negligible variation between the pseudo -true 
parameter θpse and the true parameter θˉ, the parameter estima ⁃
tion error lower bound of the true AoA θˉ can be denoted as
Ep{(θ̂-θˉ)}≥LB(θˉ), (22)
where LB(θˉ) is defined as an LB of the true AoA parameter θˉ, 
which can be rewritten as
LB(θˉ)=CRLB(θpse)+(θpse-θˉ)2
, (23)
where (θ̂-θˉ)2
=(θ̂-θpse)2
+(θpse-θˉ)2
+2(θ̂-θpse)(θpse-θˉ) 
and Ep{(θ̂-θpse)(θpse-θˉ)}=Ep{(θ̂-θpse)}(θpse-θˉ)=0 due 
to the unbiased estimate . Hence , in order to calculate the LB 
of the true AoA parameter precisely , the variation between the 
pseudo -true parameter and the true AoA parameter ϑ=θpse-
θˉ should be detected firstly .
To obtain the accurate value of ϑ, we need to find a pseudo -
true parameter θpse that can minimize the KL divergence between 
the distributions under the realistic channel model and the sim ⁃
plified channel model , as shown in Eq . (16). However , this step 
has a high computational complexity due to the non -convex func ⁃
tion expression . Fortunately , in order to minimize the KL diver ⁃
gence between p(ysub,{θˉ, rˉ}) and p͂(ysub, θpse), the value of ϑ 
can also be obtained through minimizing the KL divergence be ⁃
tween the realistic steering vector wsub{θˉ, rˉ} and the simplified 
steering vector asim(θˉ+ϑ)[34], which can be expressed as
ϑ=argmin
ϑ∈)[0,2π  asim() θˉ+ϑ-wsub()θˉ, rˉ2
. (24)
Let ϖ(ϑ)=  asim() θˉ+ϑ-wsub()θˉ, rˉ2

Hence , in order to minimize ϖ(ϑ), the value of ϑ can be 
taken as the symmetry axis of the quadratic convex function in 
Eq. (26), i.e., ϑ=-BA, which can be calculated as

Finally , the LB of the true AoA parameter θˉ can be calcu ⁃
lated as
LB(θˉ)=CRLB(θpse)+ϑ2. (30)
By substituting Eqs . (21) and (29) into Eq . (30), Theorem 1 
has been proved .
The LB of the AoA parameter is composed of two parts . The 
first part is the CRLB of the pseudo -true parameter estimate , 
which is inversely proportional to the signal -to-noise ratio 
(SNR) and N3
sub. The SNR is defined as
SNR=P||g2
σ2. (31)
The second part is the variance caused by the channel 
model mismatch , which is inversely proportional to r2. We can 
find that the AoA ’s LB mainly depends on the scale of the c -
subarray , the SNR and the distance from the transmitter to the 
center of the XL -HRIS . The following lemmas can be obtained
