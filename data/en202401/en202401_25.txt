We set the reader sensitivity  Preader, sen≈-86 dBm, the reader 
antenna gain G=5  dBi, the tag antenna gain Gtag=2 dBi, po⁃
larization mismatch β=0.5, and coefficient α = 1[22].
Suppose that the tag adopts the binary phase shift keying 
(BPSK ) modulation mode . Due to the influence of factors such 
as RF switch and transmission line impedance , the actual re ⁃
flection coefficient is often less than 1. When the tag adopts 
the BPSK modulation , the values of the measured reflection 
coefficients are Γ1=-0.69+0.32 j and  Γ2=0.67-0.23 j, 
respectively . Figs . 5 and 6 are respectively signal power re ⁃
ceived by the tag chip and the reader when transmission 
power of the reader Pt=10,  15  and 20 dBm, respectively .
When the tag chip received power equals to the envelope 
detection threshold power (Ptag, chip=Pchip, sen), the downlink up ⁃
per bound communication distance ddown≈ 2.30  m. Similarly , 
when Pr=Preader, sen, the uplink upper bound communication 
distance dup≈16.76  m. Final upper bound communication 
distance dM=min{ddown,  dup}=2.30  m. In the real -world 
test, the restriction of the software program on the signaling 
preamble is reduced , and the tag cannot receive signaling in ⁃
formation when approaching the upper bound distance . At this 
time there is no comparison voltage output from the viewing 
comparator and envelope signal output from the envelope de ⁃
tection . Accordingly , we conclude that the downlink distance 
is mainly limited by the envelope detection threshold .
Based on the previous measurements and analysis , we pro ⁃
pose to implement an LNA module after the tag antenna recep ⁃
tion. As shown in Fig . 7, the added LNA amplifies the 
strength of the signal received by the tag while minimizing the 
noise in the signal to ensure that the signal -to-noise ratio 
(SNR) can be maintained at a high level when the signal is 
transmitted and processed in the system . Since the LNA am ⁃
plifies the voltage input to the envelope detection , the tag is 
easier to detect the downlink signaling . The gain of LNA GLNA=21  dB. The tag chip sensitivity remains unchanged , 
but the threshold power Pth,LNA at the arrival of the tag antenna 
decreases to Pth-GLNA. Eventually , the sensitivity of the la ⁃
bels is roughly improved by  GLNA.
5 Performance Analysis
The signal power Ptag,chip and Ptag,chip,LNA received by tag 
chips versus the distance are plotted in Fig . 8, where the trans ⁃
mission power of the reader is set as Pt=15 dBm . We use the
