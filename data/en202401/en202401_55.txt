setup , for weapons with high probability of getting high re ⁃
wards , more attempts are required to get a certain cumulative 
reward . Combining the adaptive learning capabilities of ma ⁃
chine learning with the domain knowledge of wireless com ⁃
munications allows interaction with changing environ ⁃
ments[40], thus enabling algorithms to adapt effectively to new 
environments .
2) Near -field characteristics -based beam training : The char ⁃
acteristics of near -field communication are the challenges and 
possible future research directions for studying near -field 
beam training methods . For example , for HMIMO near -field 
communication systems , the near -field beam splitting effect 
poses a new challenge to beam training , where beams gener ⁃
ated at different frequencies are distorted to different loca ⁃
tions . To overcome this challenge , an effective broadband rain ⁃
bow beam training scheme is proposed[41], which utilizes a true 
time delay (TTD) device to flexibly control the near -field beam 
splitting effect in order to achieve fast beam training . Also , 
based on the distance -domain and angle -domain dimensional 
challenges due to the near -field spherical wave properties , a 
2D polar -domain codebook is proposed[21], where each beam 
codeword points to a specific location with a target angle and 
distance . In terms of angle and distance sampling , the sam ⁃
pling can be designed to minimize the column coherence of 
neighboring code words .
6 Conclusions
In this paper , we provide a comprehensive overview of 
near -field beam training for HMIMO communication sce ⁃
narios . Specifically , we first introduce the characteristics of 
near -field communication in HMIMO scenarios , and the dif ⁃
ferences between beam training in near -field and far -field 
conditions . Then , based on the system model of the interest 
scenario and the codebook forms for beam training , we intro ⁃
duce several typical methods for near -field beam training : ex⁃
haustive beam training , hierarchical beam training and multi -
beam training . Also , we discuss some potential application 
scenarios of near -field beam training . Our performance analy ⁃
sis compares the effectiveness of these methods and confirms 
their validity on the hardware testbed . Moreover , we discuss 
the research challenges of near -field beam training and pro ⁃
pose several possible future research directions . In the fu ⁃
ture, we will propose more efficient near -field beam training 
methods for HMIMO scenarios .
