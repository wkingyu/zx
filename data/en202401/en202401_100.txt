The original filter is shown in Fig . 2. The noise spectrum of 
the prototype with the original EMI filter is shown in Fig . 3.
Comparing the CM noise spectrum in Fig . 1 with that in Fig . 
3, we find that the CM insertion loss with the original filter is 
about 20 dB–40 dB in the low and medium frequency bands .
Fig. 4 shows the schematic of the CM equivalent circuit of 
the second -order π-type EMI filter . In Fig . 4(b), Zs is con ⁃
nected in parallel with the Y capacitor in the second -order π
-type filter , and Zs is much smaller than the Y capacitor in the 
second -order π-type filter in the low and middle frequency 
bands , so the effect of Zs can be ignored in this analysis .
The insertion loss of the second -order π-type filter can be 
obtained as :
ILcm=20log|8Lcm1Lcm2Cy1Cy2Cy3Rcm⋅s5+4Lcm1Lcm2Cy2Cy3s4+
[4Lcm1RcmCy1(Cy2+Cy3)+4Lcm2RcmCy3 ] (Cy1+Cy2)s3+
2(Lcm1Cy2+Lcm2Cy3+Lcm1)Cy3s2+2Rcm(Cy1+Cy3+Cy3)s+1.(1)
According to Eq . (1), the insertion loss of the original filter 
is about 200 dB–300 dB in the low and medium frequency 
bands . The actual insertion loss of the filter does not reach the 
theoretical value .
3 Filter Ground Impedance
The original EMI filter has a large ground 
loop, which results in a large ground imped ⁃
ance. The effect of ground impedance on 
CM insertion loss will be verified by simula ⁃
tion. The simulation schematic is shown in 
Fig. 5. The CM insertion loss considering 
ground impedance is shown in Fig . 6(a), 
and Fig . 6(b) shows the insertion loss of the 
ideal filter .
Fig. 6(a) illustrates that the resonance of 
the insertion loss of the filter is advanced 
and the insertion loss is reduced after the 
addition of the ground impedance . Due to 
the large Y capacitor used in the original fil ⁃
ter, even a small ground impedance will re ⁃
sult in the resonance frequency decrease of 
the insertion loss . Therefore , in order to re ⁃
duce EMI noise , the EMI filter electrical pa ⁃
rameters need to be designed .
4 Noise Source Impedance Ex ⁃
traction
It is necessary to extract the source im ⁃
pedance of the prototype noise source be ⁃
fore designing the filter . The equivalent 
model of CM noise transmission path with ⁃
out a filter is shown in Fig . 7.
The equivalent CM noise current Icm is:
