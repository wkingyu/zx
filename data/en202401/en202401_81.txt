Abstract : Cell -free (CF) multiple -input multiple -output (MIMO ) is a promising technique to enable the vision of ubiquitous wireless connec ⁃
tivity for next -generation network communications . Compared to traditional co -located massive MIMO , CF MIMO allows geographically dis ⁃
tributed access points (APs) to serve all users on the same time -frequency resource with spatial multiplexing techniques , resulting in better 
performance in terms of both spectral efficiency and coverage enhancement . However , the performance gain is achieved at the expense of de ⁃
ploying more APs with high cost and power consumption . To address this issue , the recently proposed reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) 
technique stands out with its unique advantages of low cost , low energy consumption and programmability . In this paper , we provide an over ⁃
view of RIS -assisted CF MIMO and its interaction with advanced optimization designs and novel applications . Particularly , recent studies on 
typical performance metrics such as energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) are surveyed . Besides , the application of RIS -assisted 
CF MIMO techniques in various future communication systems is also envisioned . Additionally , we briefly discuss the technical challenges 
and open problems for this area to inspire research direction and fully exploit its potential in meeting the demands of future wireless communi ⁃
cation systems .

1 Introduction
With the promising new technologies such as the mil ⁃
limeter wave (mmWave ), massive multiple -input 
multiple -output (MIMO ), and ultra -dense network 
(UDN ), 5G wireless communication and beyond 
can provide increased data rates , as well as reduced latency , 
higher reliability , and greater connectivity , which further sup ⁃
ports novel applications such as telemedicine and remote driv ⁃
ing[1–3]. However , there are new challenges in practical de ⁃
ployment of these technologies . For example , mmWave suffers 
from low penetration and is vulnerable to interference , leading 
to limited signal coverage . Besides , massive MIMO and UDN 
require the intensive deployment of more co -located antennas 
and base stations (BSs). This incurs high costs and power con ⁃
sumption . Furthermore , as cell density increases , inter -cell in ⁃
terference becomes dominant , which negatively affects the sys ⁃
tem performance[4].Recently , a novel user -centric network mechanism called 
cell -free (CF) MIMO was proposed to address the issue[5–7].In 
CF MIMO systems , geographically distributed access points 
(APs) cooperate to serve all user equipment (UE) without cell 
boundaries through coherent transmission , as shown in Fig . 1.
