Abstract : Weakly -coupled mode division multiplexing (MDM ) technique is considered a promising candidate to enhance the capacity of an 
optical transmission system , in which mode multiplexers/demultiplexers (MMUX/MDEMUX ) with low insertion loss and modal crosstalk are 
the key components . In this paper , a low -modal -crosstalk 4-mode MMUX/MDEMUX for the weakly -coupled triple -ring -core few -mode fiber 
(TRC -FMF ) is designed and fabricated with side -polishing processing . The measurement results show that a pair of MMUX/MDEMUX and 
25 km weakly -coupled TRC -FMF MDM link achieve low modal crosstalk of lower than −17.5 dB and insertion loss of lower than 11.56 dB for 
all the four modes . Based on the TRC -FMF and all -fiber MMUX/MDEMUX , an experiment for 25 km real -time 4-mode 3-λ wavelength divi ⁃
sion multiplexing (WDM )-MDM transmission is conducted using commercial 400G optical transport network (OTN ) transceivers . The experi ⁃
mental results prove weakly -coupled MDM techniques facilitate a smooth upgrade of the optical transmission system .

1 Introduction
The explosive increase of network users and various 
communication services such as the Internet of Things 
(IoT) and cloud computing has constantly requested 
the capacity enhancement of optical transmission sys ⁃
tems and networks . However , recent studies have shown that 
the capacity usage of single -mode fiber (SMF) is tending to its 
nonlinear Shannon limit by combining various advanced trans ⁃
mission techniques[1]. Mode division multiplexing (MDM ) tech ⁃
nique utilizing linearly -polarized (LP) modes in few -mode fi ⁃
bers (FMFs ) has attracted great attention as a promising ap ⁃
proach to enhancing the capacity of optical fiber communica ⁃
tion systems[2–3], but the inevitable modal crosstalk induced by 
the mode multiplexer/demultiplexer (MMUX/MDEMUX ) and 
optical fiber transmission is hard to be suppressed . Two techni ⁃
cal routes have been widely investigated to solve this problem . 
In a strongly -coupled MDM strategy without modal crosstalk suppression[4–6], coherent detection and massive N×N (N>2) 
multiple -input multiple -output (MIMO ) digital signal process ⁃
ing (DSP) have to be utilized to equalize each MDM channel 
at the receiver for achieving long -distance high -speed MDM 
transmission . However , the computational complexity and 
cost for MIMO -DSP can increase dramatically with longer 
FMF links and more LP modes , which is not compatible with 
commercial coherent optical modules utilizing polarization di ⁃
vision multiplexing (PDM ) and only 2×2 MIMO -DSP[7]. An⁃
other promising MDM strategy is weakly -coupled transmis ⁃
sion approaches that suppress the modal crosstalk from 
MMUX/MDEMUX and FMFs as much as possible and are 
compatible with conventional intensity modulation/direct de ⁃
tection (IM/DD ) transceivers and commercial high -speed co ⁃
herent optical modules[8–9]. In this route , multiple -ring -core 
(MRC ) weakly -coupled FMFs are designed to effectively sup ⁃
press the distributed modal crosstalk (DMC ) among different 
LP modes by enlarging effective index difference (Δneff) be⁃
tween different LP modes[10]. Moreover , a 3-circular -mode 
real -time MDM transmission utilizing 200G quadrature phase
