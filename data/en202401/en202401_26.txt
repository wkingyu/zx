same configuration as those in Fig . 5.
When Ptag, chip, LNA =Pchip, sen, we can obtain that the upper 
bound of downlink communication distance can be 25.75 m, 
i.e., ddown,LNA≈25.75  m. After implementing the LNA , the 
downlink upper bound communication range is improved by 
23.45 m.
The test environment is depicted in Fig . 9, where a USRP 
is in conjunction with a PC as an integrated system . The 
USRP is typically used as the radio front -end hardware , re⁃
sponsible for receiving and transmitting radio signals . The 
PC is used for processing and analyzing these received sig ⁃
nals. The transmission and reception of radio frequency sig ⁃
nals are realized by connecting the antenna with a circulator . 
The operating frequency is 925 MHz , and the transmission 
power Pt=15 dBm . We measure the upper bound distance as 
the maximum distance at which the tag can correctly recog ⁃
nize the signaling . Our final measurement results indicate 
that, after implementing the LNA module , the communication 
range is increased by approximately 20 m.In MBCS , the tag can identify smaller signals after imple ⁃
menting the LNA module . According to our analysis , the 
downlink sensitivity is the bottleneck that sets the upper 
bounds of the overall communication range . The improvement 
in the downlink communication distance consequently leads 
to an improved uplink distance , lower reader power consump ⁃
tion and enhanced communication performance . It is worth 
noting that these benefits can also be achieved in some BBCS 
configurations . Improving tag sensitivity will result in an ex ⁃
tended maximum effective communication distance between 
the RF carrier source and the tag .
6 Conclusions
In this paper , we analyze the uplink and downlink budgets 
and measure the chip sensitivity of the tag for ambient IoT . 
According to the relationship between sensitivity and the re ⁃
ceived power , we derive the upper bounds of both uplink and 
downlink distances . It is found that the backscatter communi ⁃
cations are mainly limited by the downlink distance , instead 
of the uplink distance . It is also found that the tag sensitivity 
results from its hardware constraints , especially the activation 
voltage of the envelope detection diode . Accordingly , we pro ⁃
pose to incorporate an LNA in the tag to amplify the incident 
signals before the envelope detection , and the corresponding 
experimental results show that the downlink communication 
range could be extended over 20 m.
