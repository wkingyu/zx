If U is the noise source , Z1 is the filter impedance , and Z2 is 
the load impedance , it is hoped that the filter impedance can 
withstand more interference voltage . Usually , the load imped ⁃
ance cannot be changed . In this case , the value of Z1 should 
be increased , so that Z1 is much larger than Z2, to ensure that 
the load is less disturbed .
If Z1 represents the source impedance and Z2 represents the 
filter impedance , in this case it is necessary to ensure that the 
noise that enters the filter is as little as possible , and the 
source impedance cannot be changed , and then Z2 should be 
much less than Z1.
The conclusion can be drawn from the above . On the load 
side, the impedance of the filter should be higher than that of 
the load ; on the noise source side , the impedance of the filter 
should be lower than the load impedance . Usually in the EMI 
filter , the inductor in series indicates high resistance , and the 
capacitor in parallel indicates low resistance .
The source impedance of the prototype noise source is ca ⁃
pacitive in the low frequency band , corresponding to low resis ⁃
tance , so the LC -type (one inductor and one capacitor ) filter 
should be selected . The source impedance of the noise source 
can be regarded as a part of the filter , that is , the noise source 
impedance side of the LC filter is parallel to an internal im ⁃
pedance capacitor , which can be equivalent to a π-type filter , 
as shown in Fig .17. Therefore , in order to better filter effect , 
you can choose a π-type filter .6 Filter Design
EMI filters play a role in the conductive EMI frequency 
range of the lower frequency band (from 150 kHz to several 
megahertz ), so the filter design is mainly for this frequency 
band design . In the design of the EMI filter , if the input of the 
device is an alternating current (AC) source , it is necessary to 
select the appropriate Y capacitor according to the AC leak ⁃
age current limit of the corresponding device . In this paper , 
the input of the wireless base station power supply prototype 
is direct current (DC) input , so the AC leakage current limit is 
not considered . In the design of the EMI filter , the capaci ⁃
tance of the Y capacitor can be used to reduce the inductance 
of the required CM inductor , reduce the volume of the CM 
choke , and achieve the compact design of the filter .
The filter of the prototype adopts a two -stage and two -
channel π-type filter , and the CM choke adopts double -wire 
and winding , with the line diameter of 1.1 mm . The single -
channel and two -channel co -currents are 26 A and 52 A, and 
the current density is about 16.522 A/mm2. The circuit of the 
original filter is shown in Fig . 2.
Fig. 18(a) represents the CM noise equivalent circuit with a 
first -order π-type filter , C1 and C2 represent the Y capacitors , 
Lcm represents the CM inductance component of the CM 
choke , and Rcm represents the LISN equivalent resistance . Cs 
indicates the impedance within the noise source . The noise 
source is transformed with the source impedance part to make 
the power supply equivalent , and the voltage source is 
equated with the current source , and the equivalent circuit 
diagram is obtained as shown in Fig . 18(b).
In Fig . 19, the noise voltage Ucm1 across Rcm in the absence 
of the filter is defined as :
Ucm1=Rcm⋅Is
jωCsRcm+1 . (22)
The parallel connection of 2C2 and Cs is set to C3, and the 
noise voltage Ucm2 across Rcm after accessing the π-type filter is :
Ucm2=
Rcm⋅Is
1-ω2Lcm(C3)+jωRcm(2C1+C3)-j2ω3RcmLcmC1C3 .(23)
Then the CM IL of the first order π-type filter is :
ILcm=

|||||1-ω2LcmC3+jωRcm(2C1+C3)-j2ω3RcmLcmC1C3
jωRcmCs+1|
|||||
.(24)
Let s=jω and substitute it into Eq . (24) to obtain the IL ex ⁃
pression for the first -order π-type filter , we can have :
ILcm(s)=
