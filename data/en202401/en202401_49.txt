3.3.1 Equal Interval Multi -Beam (EIMB ) Training
First, the (horizontal ) antennas or reflective elements are di ⁃
vided into M subarrays , each consisting of L≜Nx/M neighbor ⁃
ing elements . For each subarray m∈M≜{1,2,…,M}, we 
equip it with a separate codebook , Wm, which consists of J=
Nx codewords covering the same sampling direction as the 
single -beam codebook , i.e., {α(j), j∈J}. Thus , we have
Wm={wm(1),wm(2),…,wm(J)},∀m∈M, (6)
where wm(j)∈CL×1, j∈J represents the codeword of subar ⁃
ray m and uses only L antennas or reflecting elements to direct 
the reflected beam in the direction  α(j). Based on the single -
beam codeword C(j), we construct wm(j) as:
wm(j)≜[C(j)]() m-1L+1:mL  . (7)
Thus , when all M subarrays turn the reflected beam in the 
same direction  α(j), the composite multi -beam encoding 
[wT
1(j),wT
2(j),…,wT
M(j)]T is equivalent to its single -beam 
counterpart C(j). Compared with the full -array codeword 
C(j), each subarray codeword w͂m(j) has a wider beam width 
(i.e., 2M/Nx versus  2/Nx) and a smaller beam gain (i.e., Nx/M 
versus Nx). Next , for the proposed multi -beam training , the BS 
is allowed to steer the subarray beams in several different di ⁃
rections simultaneously , usually according to the multi -beam 
codebook Wm, m∈M varying over the duration of the train ⁃
ing symbols . By appropriately designing the beam directions 
of the BS subarrays on different training symbols , the optimal 
beam direction for each user can be found with high probabil ⁃
ity by a simple comparison of the received signal power/SNR . 
For ease of exposition , we consider a typical case where M=
2R, R∈Z, and L are even numbers , Nx=ML. The proposed 
fast beam training method consists of two phases , namely 
beam scanning and beam identification , as described below .
1) The beam scanning phase consists of 1+log2 M rounds 
in which the set of BS subarray beam directions sends mul ⁃
tiple training symbols . For each 
round r∈{1,2,…, log2 M+1}, we 
denote B(r, b) as the collection of 
subarray beam directions (in as ⁃
cending order ) during the b-th train ⁃
ing symbol . For any set of beam di ⁃
rections A⊆J, we define its intra -
set distance as
ds(A)= min
p, q∈A;p≠q |p-q|. (8)
Thus , a larger in -set distance in ⁃
dicates that the beams indexed by 
A are farther apart in the spatial do ⁃
main . For r=1, the Nx directions are mapped into L bins , each bin including M directions . In 
order to separate the beam directions in each bin as much as 
possible to minimize inter -beam interference , the bins are 
set to
B(1, b)={ } b, b+L,…,b+(M-1)L,∀b∈{ } 1,2,…, L ,(9)
which maximizes the minimum bin distance among all bins , 
ds(B(1,b))=L, ∀b∈{1,2,…,L}, as shown in Fig . 3. Then , for 
each group ℓ, an odd subset of  B(1, ℓ), and an even subset of ℓ
B(1, ℓ+L/2) are extracted to construct a new bin . In addi ⁃
tion, for each round of beam sweeping , the same (maximum ) 
intra -bin distance for different bins can be numerically de ⁃
rived as
ds(B(r,b))=ì
í
îïï
ïïL,      if r∈{}1,2,
L/2, if r∈{ } 3,4,…, log2M+1. (10)
Finally , the total number of training symbols is

t=L+L(log 2M)
2=Nx
M()1+log 2M
2 . (11)
2) Beam identification : after the scanning phase , each user 
can independently identify its optimal BS beam direction based 
on its own received power/SNR in the first phase . Consider an 
arbitrary user k. Let Pk(r, b) denote its received power at bin b 
in the r-th sweep round and Î
k(r) denote the set of candidate di ⁃
rections for its optimal beam direction after the r-th sweep 
round . For r=1, Î
k(r) is set to be the best bin with the maxi ⁃
mum received power , i.e., Î
k(1)=B(1, b*
k), b*
k=
arg max 
b∈{1,2,…,L}Pk(1, b). For each subsequent round 
r∈{2,3,…,log 2M+1}, the user only needs to check a bin that 
has a common direction with Î
k(1), since it is the only one that 
may contain the optimal beam direction , denoted by B(r,bk(r)), 
where bk(r)={b∈{1,2,…, L/2}|B(r,b)∩Î
k(1)≠∅}. For this 
bin, since the expected received power of the corresponding
