istics , distance information needs to be considered in the near -
field channel modeling . Furthermore , with the emergence of 
large -scale antenna arrays , the dimension of the channel be ⁃
comes large and the computational complexity for transmis ⁃
sion scheme design also greatly increases , which becomes a 
key design challenge in near -field scenarios . Moreover , the 
unique spatial non -stationary characteristics in the near field 
make the performance characteristics and algorithm design 
different from those in the far field with conventional station ⁃
ary channels . This necessitates the exploration of more accu ⁃
rate near -field channel models and raises a new challenge : 
how to design new transmission schemes based on the charac ⁃
teristics of the near -field channel .
3.3.2 Existing Works
The near -field channel introduces several new channel 
characteristics : the spherical wave property of the propagating 
signal and the spatial non -stationary property . Recently , some 
researchers have confirmed the existence of spatial non -
stationary properties in near -field channels[26, 57], i.e., the user’
s transmitted signal may only be received by a small part of 
the array . Based on this characteristic , the authors of Ref . [26] 
proposed a channel model based on VRs . To reduce the com ⁃
putational complexity and by exploiting the nature of VRs , the 
authors of Ref . [58] proposed a graph -based linear receiving 
algorithm inspired by random access . Moreover , an antenna 
selection algorithm was proposed in Ref . [59] to improve the 
total energy efficiency of the system . However , the above work 
assumes that the VR information is known and the arrays 
other than the VR receive signal amplitude with values of 
zero, which is impractical . To fill these gaps , the authors of 
Ref. [60] first derived a near -field channel model considering 
antenna polarization based on the EM field theory . Then , a de ⁃
tection algorithm for VRs was proposed , which can obtain VR 
information of different users . Finally , the authors proposed a 
linear detection algorithm based on VRs , exploiting VRs infor ⁃
mation for different users to reduce the computational com ⁃
plexity . In the following part , we present details of the re ⁃
search work in Ref . [60].3.3.3 Transmission Scheme Design for Near -Field with Spatial 
Non -Stationaries
The authors of Ref . [60] considered an uplink transmission 
system with multiple single -antenna users and an XL -MIMO 
base station , as shown in Fig. 9.
The channel between the (mx, my)-th antenna element of 
the base station and user k can be expressed as
hk,mx,my=ξk,mx,mye-jχk,mx,my,(26)
where ξk,mx,myand χk,mx,my denote the channel coefficient and 
phase , respectively .
Then , the authors derive a near -field channel model that 
takes polarization mismatch into account by using the inhomo ⁃
geneous Helmholtz wave equation and Green ’s function . We 
first define the Δx and Δy as the antenna spacing along the x-
axis and y-axis, respectively . After that , by assuming the loca ⁃
tion of user k and the (mx,my)-th antenna element as uk=
[uk,x,uk,y,uk,z]T and pmx,my=[mΔx, mΔy, 0]T, respectively , the 
channel coefficient and phase are given by :
