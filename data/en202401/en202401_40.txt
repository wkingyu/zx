where k0=2π/λ is the wavenumber in vacuum and j is the 
imaginary unit ; β and γ are the tilting angles mentioned in 
Fig. 1. Note that ZT and ZR are the self -impedance of the trans ⁃
mitting and receiving antennas and can be easily evaluated by 
a classical antenna impedance theory from CHU[20]. Theoreti ⁃
cally , the impedance matrix of the Tx and Rx arrays can be de ⁃
termined by calculating all the mutual -impedance between an ⁃
tennas , forming a Tx self -impedance matrix ZT and Rx self -
impedance matrix ZR. By altering the spacing into the mutual 
coupling region (i.e. δ<λ/2), this model can be extended to 
an HMIMO system where the Tx 􀆳s strong mutual coupling 
should be considered .
2.2 Spatial Correlation of Impedance Matrix
We employ the rank definition to extract the DOF property 
of the circuit model for HMIMO . The channel model follows 
the work by AKROUT et al .[18] The explicit expression of the 
channel matrix is given by
H(f)=β0RinPZRTQ, (7)
where β0 is a readout amplification coefficient , Rin is the inter ⁃
nal resistance of the receiving antenna , and P and Q are two 
auxiliary impedance matrices defined as
P≜(ZR+RinIM×M)-1, (8)
Q≜(ZT+RIN×N-ZTRPZRT)-1, (9)
where IM×M and IN×N are identity matrices with M and N rows 
respectively .
Note that the circuit model decomposes the channel matrix 
into a product of the self -impedance matrices (ZT and ZR) and 
the trans -impedance matrix (ZTR). The rank of the channel ma ⁃
trix is then determined by the minimum rank of P, ZRT, and Q. 
Recall the basic assumptions of HMIMO system that the Rx 
has weak coupling . Therefore , ZR is a diagonal matrix and of 
full rank . To study the properties of ZT and ZTR, we make an ⁃
other assumption that the differences in the current distribu ⁃
tion caused by the feed position are negligible . The configura ⁃
tion of the array indicates that the mutual impedance model 
M(δ, β, γ) has two fixed components β and γ. If we set β=π and γ=0, the entries of ZT is
ZT,mn∝-(1
(jk0δmn)2+1
(jk0δmn)3)exp(-jk0δmn),
(10)
where k0=2π/λ is the wavenumber in vacuum . The imped ⁃
ance approches 0 asymptotically if the spacing is bigger than 
λ/2, which is the condition of a traditional weak coupling array .
We then derive a formula for estimating the rank of the im ⁃
pedance matrix ZT for a ULA . Since the impedance matrix is 
only a function of the distance between the i-th and j-th anten ⁃
nas, the row vectors of ZT have cyclic symmetry . Therefore , 
the rank of ZT is bounded by the auto -correlation of the row 
vectors . The auto -correlation of the first row vector ZT0 is 
given by
ℜ[ZT0ZT0]∝

exp(-jk0(δ0m+δ0n)) ,                                                                      (11)
where δ0m denotes the distance between the first and m-th 
antenna .
The numerical evaluation (Fig. 2) shows that the mutual 
coupling increases the spatial correlation between the exciting 
antenna and its neighboring antenna . This is an exact answer 
to the DOF degradation for fixed antenna numbers when the 
mutual coupling is considered . This is in agreement with the 
spatial correlation matrix reported by YUAN et al .[17]
However , increasing the number of antennas within a fixed 
aperture would provide additional DOF compared to the half -
wavelength weak coupling array due to the rapid decrease of 
the correlation for antennas with spacing bigger than λ/2. The 
asymptotic DOF provided by the mutual coupling for ULA can 
be estimated by subtracting the λ/2δ antennas from the total
