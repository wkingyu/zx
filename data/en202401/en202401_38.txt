Abstract : Degree of freedom (DOF ) is a key indicator for spatial multiplexing layers of a wireless channel . Traditionally , the channel of a 
multiple -input multiple -output (MIMO ) half -wavelength dipole array has a DOF that equals the antenna number . However , recent studies sug ⁃
gest that the DOF could be less than the antenna number when strong mutual coupling is considered . We utilize a mutual -coupling -compliant 
channel model to investigate the DOF of the holographic MIMO (HMIMO ) channel and give a upper bound of the DOF with strong mutual cou ⁃
pling . Our numerical simulations demonstrate that a dense array can support more DOF per unit aperture as compared with a half -wavelength 
MIMO system .

1 Introduction
Holographic MIMO (HMIMO ) is a new concept of com ⁃
munication technology , which has attracted increas ⁃
ing interest from researchers[1–5]. There are two ma ⁃
jor types of HMIMO systems . One of them is commu ⁃
nicating through a transmitting array with possibly uncount ⁃
able antennas[6]. The other refers to collecting and forming the 
phase information through the holographic principle[7–9]. Both 
types of HMIMO communication systems offer increased capa ⁃
bility for electromagnetic field manipulation , therefore indicat ⁃
ing an increase in the degree of freedom (DOF ) of the spatial 
channel .
The DOF can be defined in three ways : the rank definition , 
the spatial multiplexing gain definition , and the bandwidth 
definition . The rank definition defines the rank of the MIMO 
channel matrix as the DOF of the system[10]. The spatial multi ⁃
plexing gain definition is the limit of the channel capacity 
over the logarithmic signal -to-noise ratio (SNR) as the SNR 
grows to infinity[11]. This definition is based on the fact that the MIMO channel capacity grows linearly with logarithmic SNR 
and the smaller number of antennas between the transmitting 
and receiving side when the SNR is large enough . The band ⁃
width definition is a direct expansion of the time -frequency 
bandwidth by applying the spatial Fourier transform to the 
spatial domain[12–14]. The conjugate domain is the so -called 
wavenumber domain , which is band -limited because the radi ⁃
ating electromagnetic waves are bounded by their vacuum 
wavenumber , such that ,

z, (2)
where k is the wavevector of the electromagnetic wave , and k=
|k|; kx, ky,  and kz are the wavevectors in xyz directions , kx=
|kx|, ky=|ky|, and kz=|kz|.
The spatial bandwidth is defined as the area in the wave ⁃
number domain supported by the possible wavevectors satisfy ⁃
ing the restrictions . Related research shows that this restric ⁃
tion forms a circular area denoted by k2
x+k2
y≤k2, which is es ⁃
