transmission , the received signal is demultiplexed by the 4-
mode MDEMUX first . Another four WSSes are then utilized to 
demultiplex the received wavelength -multiplexed signals . Fi⁃
nally , each demultiplexed signal is detected by the 400G OTN 
receivers for real -time bit -error rate (BER ) calculation .
3.2 Transmission Results and Discussion
We input each LP mode one by one and measure the BER 
at different input power . The results are shown in Fig . 6(a). 
We can see that two non -degenerate modes (LP01 and LP02) 
have low BERs while the BERs of two degenerate modes (LP11 
and LP21) are relatively large . This is because the degenerate 
modes have 4-fold degeneracy and suffer from large intra -LP-
mode dispersion (ILMD ), which is also the main reason that 
limits the transmission distance in this experiment[18]. This 
part of the damage can be mitigated by optimizing the optical fiber processing methods , which will 
achieve a longer transmission dis ⁃
tance . Then the four LP modes are 
launched simultaneously and the 
curves of BER for all the four modes 
versus input power are depicted in 
Fig. 6(b). We can see that the BERs 
of the degenerate modes are still 
larger than those of the non -
degenerate modes but the BERs are 
all below the 27%-overhead soft -
decision forward -error -correction (SD-
FEC) limit (3.7×10-2) of the OTN 
transceivers . Fig . 6(c) shows the 
BERs of 3-λ×4-mode× 400G simulta ⁃
neous transmission . The input power 
of LP01, LP11, LP21, and LP02 modes to 
the MDM link is 5.4 dBm , 9.3 dBm , 
8.1 dBm , and 6.8 dBm for power bal ⁃
ancing . We can find that the BERs of 
the four LP modes at the three wavelengths across the C -band 
are all under the SD -FEC limit . These results indicate that our 
MDM transmission system has a wide operating bandwidth and 
can realize a 4-mode real -time transmission of more than 40 
wavelengths with 100 GHz channel spacing over the C -band . 
By further optimizing the bandwidth of the MMUX/MDEMUX , 
we can achieve the 4-mode real -time transmission with more 
than 80 wavelengths using the same experimental setup .
4 Conclusions
In this paper , a low -modal -crosstalk 4-mode MMUX and 
MDEMUX for weakly -coupled TRC -FMF is designed and fab ⁃
ricated with side -polishing processing . The measurement re ⁃
sults show that a pair of MMUX/MDEMUX and 25 km weakly -
coupled TRC -FMF MDM link achieve low modal crosstalk of
