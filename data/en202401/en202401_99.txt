Abstract : The design of electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters needs to fulfill the EMI standards . Designing a filter is a time -consuming 
process for new engineers as well as for those experienced engineers . This paper measures and compares the noise spectrum of the wireless 
base station power prototype with and without the original filter . The ideal insertion loss (IL) of the original filter is obtained by combining cal ⁃
culation and simulation . It is pointed out that the effect of the original filter is not good . Based on the improved insertion -loss method , the 
source impedance model of the prototype is established by combining measurement and theory . A procedure for designing EMI filters for 
switch power supply will be presented . The filter design procedure makes it possible to design filters quickly and easily . Finally , the proposed 
filter design method is proved to be effective by the EMI measurement of the wireless base station power supply prototype .

1 Introduction
With the development of power electronic equip ⁃
ment , electromagnetic interference (EMI) has be ⁃
come more and more serious . According to the dif ⁃
ferent coupling paths , EMI can be divided into 
conduction EMI and radiation EMI . The main solution to re ⁃
ducing these conducted emissions is based on the use of EMI 
filters[1–2]. The EMI filters are made from coupled inductors 
combined with capacitors . The choice of fil ⁃
ter topology depends on networks and im ⁃
pedances . Generally , common mode (CM) 
and differential mode (DM) filters are used 
for power converters . The conventional filter 
design flow is proposed by SHIH et al .[3]
EMI filters are widely used with the ad ⁃
vantages of simple structure and low cost[4]. 
We first measure and compare the noise 
spectrum of the wireless base station power 
supply prototype with and without the origi ⁃
nal filter[5]. The results show that the ground 
impedance is the key factor affecting the in ⁃
sertion loss (IL) of the EMI filter . After that , 
based on the improved insertion -loss 
method[6], the electrical model of the source 
impedance of the prototype is established 
by combining measurement and theory , and the accuracy of the insertion -loss method to extract the source 
impedance is verified by experiments[7–9]. Finally , the filter is 
designed for the prototype , and the correctness of the EMI fil ⁃
ter design is verified by simulation and measurement .
