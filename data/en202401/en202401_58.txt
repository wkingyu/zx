2 Theory of Bessel Beam
The concept of the Bessel beam is inspired by the scalar wave 
equation in free space . When considering only the intensity of 
the electric field and neglecting its directionality , the wave equa ⁃
tion can be expressed by the following scalar expression[5]:
(∇2-1
c2∂2
∂t2)E(x, y, z, t)=0.
(1)
The Bessel beam , as an exact non -singular solution to the 
above equation for scalar fields propagating into the source -
free region z≥0, can be expressed in the axisymmetric form 
as follows :
E(x, y, z, t)=exp[i(βz-
ωt)]∫02π
exp[ ] iα( ) xcosϕ+ysinϕ=
exp[i(βz-ωt)]J0(αρ), (2)
where x, y and z represent the three -dimensional coordinates , 
and ρ2=x2+y2; β and α represent the longitudinal and trans ⁃
verse wave vectors , respectively , and β2+α2=(ω/c)2; J0 rep⁃
resents the zero -order Bessel function of the first kind . The most 
remarkable feature of the Bessel beam is that , when the wave 
number β is real , it generates a non -diffracting field , that is , its 
time -averaged intensity profile is independent of z:
I(x, y, z⩾0)=1
2|E(x, y, z, t)|2
=I(x, y, z=0).(3)
For reference , an ideal Bessel beam profile is illustrated in 
Fig. 1[17]. Compared with other forms of beam focusing , such as linear beamforming and focused beams , the key distinction of 
Bessel beams lies in their objective to achieve focusing along a 
line. The Bessel beam can be conceptually understood as “a 
beam propagating along a line ”, spreading in space as a cylin ⁃
der. On the contrary , the traditional phased array linearly 
shifted beam can be understood as “a beam pointing in a direc ⁃
tion”, spreading in space as a cone , and the focused beam can 
be considered as a “beam pointing to a point ”, achieving spatial 
concentration at a single point . Therefore , compared with other 
beamforming techniques , Bessel beams have a larger focusing 
range and the advantage of not diffusing in the propagation di ⁃
rection , allowing for their self -healing property .
However , one can easily find from Eq . (2) that an ideal Bessel 
beam would require an infinite generating aperture and infinite 
energy because it is not square integrable . The actually gener ⁃
ated Bessel beam is represented by a truncated version of Eq . 
(2) with a finite aperture at the xOy plane , given by the follow ⁃

The truncated Bessel beam is illustrated in Fig . 2. Based on 
Fig. 2 and Eq . (4), it can be observed that the truncated Bessel 
beam can be regarded as a superposition of a series of plane 
waves with the same amplitude and the same angle relative to 
the z-axis, but different azimuthal angles distributed in the range 
of 0 to 2π. Such a series of plane waves will produce a geometri ⁃
cal shadow zone , i.e., a region where the truncated Bessel beam 
cannot maintain its non -diffracting characteristics . Therefore , 
the propagation range of the truncated Bessel beam is given as :
Ring system of the Bessel beam
Center lobe of the Bessel beam
Ideal propagation volume
The center lobe of the 
Bessel beam remains stabley
