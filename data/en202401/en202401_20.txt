Abstract : Backscatter communications will play an important role in connecting everything for beyond 5G (B5G) and 6G systems . One open 
challenge for backscatter communications is that the signals suffer a round -trip path loss so that the communication distance is short . In this 
paper , we first calculate the communication distance upper bounds for both uplink and downlink by measuring the tag sensitivity and reflec ⁃
tion coefficient . It is found that the activation voltage of the envelope detection diode of the downlink tag is the main factor limiting the back ⁃
scatter communication distance . Based on this analysis , we then propose to implement a low -noise amplifier (LNA ) module before the enve ⁃
lope detection at the tag to enhance the incident signal strength . Our experimental results on the hardware platform show that our method can 
increase the downlink communication range by nearly 20 m.

1 Introduction
Backscatter communications (BackCom ), a key technol ⁃
ogy for ambient Internet of Things (AIoT ), have the ad ⁃
vantages of low hardware cost , low maintenance , easy 
deployment and flexible extension , and will play an 
important role in connecting everything for B 5G and 6G sys ⁃
tems. It was first introduced in the late 1940 s by 
STOCKMAN[1]. Afterward , the radio frequency identification 
(RFID )[2] system enabled by BackCom has been widely used 
for commodity identification , item tracking , logistic manage ⁃
ment , etc. Recently , the third -generation partnership project 
(3GPP) started investigating the scenarios , use cases , services 
and targets of the potential use of BackCom in future wireless 
networks , and the corresponding network is referred to as am ⁃
bient IoT[3] in Release 19.
Different from traditional wireless communications , the backscatter transmitters (e.g., tags , devices , and sensors ) do 
not need to generate the carrier signal by itself . BackCom 
transmits information by reflecting the received RF signal in a 
modulated way . So, it leaves out the RF units of traditional 
communication equipment such as a local oscillator , a mixer , 
and a duplexer , which greatly simplifies the RF frontend and 
reduces the power consumption dedicated to RF signal trans ⁃
mission . As a consequence , backscatter devices do not need 
batteries but can accomplish wireless signal reception and 
transmission by wireless energy harvesting (EH) and Back ⁃
Com, which significantly improves its sustainability[4–6]. 
Therefore , BackCom has been regarded as a promising solu ⁃
tion to passive and green IoT .
One open challenge for BackCom is that the signals suffer a 
round -trip path loss so that the communication distance is 
short , which is largely different from traditional point -to-point 
communications . Specifically , the signals in traditional point -
to-point communication systems experience a one -way path 
loss, and both the transmitter and receiver are equipped with 
power amplifiers to enhance signal quality . As a result , it is 
relatively easier to achieve long -range communication . In con ⁃
