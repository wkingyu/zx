mance compared with image anchor gain . A feature compres ⁃
sion framework based on the principal component analysis 
(PCA) and DeepCABAC was proposed in Ref . [40]. First , per⁃
form PCA transformation on the output of the P -layer features 
by Faster R -CNN X 101 -FPN. Considering the number of P 2 
layer feature data is large , down -sampling is used on the P 2 
layer features and will be down -sampled and merged into the 
P3 layer feature map according to the channel dimension . 
Then divide P 4, P5 and P 3 layer feature maps combined with 
the P 2 layer into three groups to perform PCA transformation 
separately , use VVC to encode the main basis vector and 
mean feature , and use DeepCABAC to perform entropy encod ⁃
ing on the transformation coefficient . This method is tested on 
the OpenImagesV 6 5K dataset , and its performance is better 
than that of the P -layer feature compression anchor and worse 
than that of the image compression anchor . The PCA technol ⁃
ogy to process the P -layer features of the FPN output was used 
in Ref . [41]. Larger sizes P 2 and P 3 are scaled and concat ⁃
enated by down -sampling , while P 4 and P 5 are processed 
separately . The PCA transformation is performed by introduc ⁃
ing a predefined mean and bias . This PCA reveals redundan ⁃
cies between channels rather than the spatial features of a 
given image expressed in the feature domain . The data are 
then quantized , rearranged and compressed with VTM .
5.1.5 Other Feature Compression Methods
The methods above have been intensively studied , while 
there are still some exploration schemes beyond the main ⁃
stream that are difficult to categorize . These methods will be 
summarized in this section to give researchers some new inspi ⁃
ration . In the MSFC method , the reduced -size feature map will 
be up -sampled by convolution , and the low -level features will 
be gradually restored from the high -level features . In terms of 
size, this step can be regarded as super -resolution . There is a 
certain redundancy between feature maps of different layers . 
Therefore , one method is to directly perform super -resolution 
on high -level features to obtain low -level features . It was 
pointed out that the P -level features had different sensitivities 
to back -end visual tasks , which was reflected in the fact that 
the bottom -level features have less influence and the top -level 
features have a greater impact[42]. Hence , this method only transmits some of the top -level features and zooms them to ob ⁃
tain bottom -level features with a super -resolution technique . 
The experimental results show that the effect of approximating 
the image anchor can be achieved by only transmitting a part 
of the features . VTM is used for feature compression .
The method of feature compression is oriented to machine 
vision tasks , and the reconstructed features can only be used 
for machine vision tasks and cannot be used to reconstruct im ⁃
ages. However , some proposals consider the feasibility of re ⁃
constructing images based on feature compression . In Ref . 
[43], the original image is encoded through feature extraction , 
and the reconstructed features can be used for back -end ma ⁃
chine vision tasks . At the same time , the reconstructed fea ⁃
tures can also be used to reconstruct the original input 
through the designed deep neural network . The experimental 
results show that the optimal peak signal -to-noise ratio 
(PNSR ) of the reconstructed image can reach 31.139 dB, 
which can restore the input image well while realizing the ma ⁃
chine vision task .
5.2 Track -1 CfE Responses
Since the method in VCM Track -1 started later than that in 
Track -2 and progressed relatively slowly , the previous meet ⁃
ings mainly collected relevant evidence for Track -1 to verify 
its effectiveness . At present , in the 140th meeting of MPEG , 
the reports of the objective results received in response to CfE 
have been sorted out and summarized , and the performance of 
proposals with better effects is shown in Table 2.
At present , a total of 6 responses to feature compression evi ⁃
dence proposals with complete and effective tests have been 
received , 4 of which have better performance than video an ⁃
chors , and all 6 proposals have better performance than image 
anchors . According to the test results , the VCM standard 
group believes that the current evidence proposals are suffi ⁃
cient enough , requesting MPEG WG 2 to carry out the drafting 
of the Call for Proposal . In recent meetings , several new pro ⁃
posals were put forward , showcasing remarkable performance . 
Among them , the most outstanding result was achieved[48], 
which has a −92.21% BD -rate gain compared with the image 
anchor for object detection tasks on the OpenImageV 6 data ⁃
set. Compared with the feature anchor , there is a −94.70% per ⁃
