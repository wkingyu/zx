For C1 and C2, we take 100 nF. According to Eq . (32), the 
inductance of the CM filter Lcm is about 300.7 μH. The actual 
CM inductance is set to 400 μH to ensure sufficient filtering 
effect .

7 Experiment
Based on the calculation and analysis , the first -order π-type 
filter of the prototype is designed , as shown in Fig . 22.
The IL of the new filter is measured using a network analyzer , 
KEYSIGHT model E 5072 A. The CM and DM IL of the filter are 
measured separately and the IL spectrum is shown in Fig . 23.
The EMI filter is designed to meet the design requirements 
for low and medium frequency bands .
The experimental environment in the filter effect verifica ⁃
tion experiment is different from the one in the previous pa ⁃
per, so the bare noise of the prototype needs to be measured 
again in the new environment . The receiver model used in the 
new experimental environment is R&S ESCI 3, the LISN is 
Schwarzbeck NNLK 8129 , and the current probe is FCC F -
35A. The noise spectrum of the wireless base station power 
supply prototype connected to the original filter is first mea ⁃sured as shown in Fig . 24.
The noise spectrum of the prototype without the original fil ⁃
ter is shown in Fig . 25. After the designed filter is connected , 
the noise spectrum of the wireless base station power supply 
prototype is shown in Fig . 26.
According to the spectrum , which can be seen in the CM 
noise spectrum and DM noise spectrum , 150 kHz–10 MHz 
noise has been basically reduced to the bottom of the EMI stan ⁃
dard line . There is a small spike at 10 MHz , but it does not ex ⁃
ceed the limits of EN 55032  Class B , and the conductive EMI 
filter noise suppression effect has been verified . The designed 
filter, without degrading the noise suppression effect , reduces 
the board area by 60% compared with the original filter , signifi ⁃
cantly reducing the size of the filter and production costs .
8 Conclusions
A practical CM EMI filter design procedure for a wireless 
base station power supply is presented . The filtering effect of 
the original filter is determined by comparing the noise spec ⁃
trum before and after accessing the original filter , and the unsat ⁃
isfactory filtering effect of the original filter is pointed out by 
combining the IL of the original filter with the theoretical calcu ⁃
lation . The effect of the ground impedance in the original filter 
on the IL is verified by theoretical analysis and simulation .
For the design of the EMI filter , the IL method is used to ex ⁃
tract the source impedance of the noise source for a wireless 
base station power supply prototype , and the effectiveness of 
the source impedance extraction is verified by experiments . 
The circuit parameters of the EMI filter are designed with a
