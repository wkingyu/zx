while the time slots with the (L+1)-th to 2L-th highest power 
are marked in blue . In Fig . 5(a), when voting is performed on the 
multi -beams corresponding to the orange markers , it is observed 
that direction 26 in BS 1 receives a significant number of votes , 
while the votes in BS 2 are more scattered . Consequently , the di ⁃
rection with the highest number of votes across both BSs is di ⁃
rection 26 in BS 1, denoted as m1=1. Subsequently , in Fig . 5
(b), voting is conducted on the remaining BS 2 using the multi -
beams marked in blue . This voting process leads to the determi ⁃
nation of m2=2 and direction 5.
Here we discuss the advantages of HMB training . Com ⁃
pared with the single -beam , multi -beam can scan multiple di ⁃
rections simultaneously , greatly reducing the number of 
beams to cover the space . Both the hashing and the equal in ⁃
terval approaches use multi -beam . However , the EIMB 
method uses a predetermined multi -beam combination ap ⁃
proach as well as a hard decision of threshold comparison , 
while the proposed hash method utilizes hashing multi -beam , 
multi -round voting , and soft decision , which are the main as ⁃
pects that make the difference .
1) HMB training employs randomly selected hash functions , 
which can be perceived as introducing a perturbation to the 
deterministic combination approach , thereby rendering the 
combination random . This randomness ensures that the sub -
beams are sufficiently dispersed , thereby reducing the impact 
of leakage interference between sub -beams , particularly after 
multiple rounds of voting . As in Fig . 4, if there is interference 
from beam 1 to 9 in the first round , but 1 and 9 are not in the 
same multi -beam in subsequent rounds , there will be no fur ⁃
ther interference from beam 1.
2) By employing an L-round voting mechanism , each round 
carries an equal weight , thus mitigating the influence of errors 
from individual rounds when L is relatively large . Moreover , 
since L is complexity dependent , we indicate that L is on the 
order of O(logMs) when the identification error is equal to 1/Ms. That is , we sacrifice some ac ⁃
curacy compared with the exhaus ⁃
tive approach but greatly reduce 
the training overhead to BlogMN.
3) Another distinction lies in the 
use of the soft decision . We con ⁃
sider the relative value , unlike the 
equal interval method that consid ⁃
ers the absolute value . This ap ⁃
proach makes it less susceptible to 
noise and variations in practical 
power strength . Hence , our method 
achieves higher accuracy and 
greater robustness .
3.4 Potential Application Scenarios
There are many potential applica ⁃
tion scenarios for near -field beam 
training , and four categories are 
highlighted here : reconfigure able intelligent surface (RIS) as⁃
sisted near -field communication systems[25], integrated sensing 
and communication (ISAC ) systems[26], high frequency (HF) 
communication[27] and low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communi ⁃
cation[28], as shown in Fig . 6.
3.4.1 RIS -Assisted Near -Field Communication
As a key technology for future wireless communications , 
RIS can manipulate electromagnetic waves , thereby improving 
the efficiency of spectrum and energy[29]. In particular , with a 
large number of passive reflective units , RIS can be pro ⁃
grammed to control the propagation environment of wireless 
communications to achieve signal enhancement or interfer ⁃
ence suppression . For high -frequency communications in 
HMIMO scenarios such as millimeter wave communications , 
the direct path between the base station and the user can be 
easily blocked by obstacles . By deploying one or more RISs[30], 
a virtual LoS BS -RIS -user link can be provided to improve its 
communication performance . As shown in Fig . 6(a), three 
kinds of links exist in the RIS -assisted communication sce ⁃
nario : the BS -RIS link , the RIS -RIS link , and the RIS -user 
link. In order to obtain a large beamforming gain , the corre ⁃
sponding beam training is required between all three paths to 
establish the link with high SNR . Because of the high frequen ⁃
cies and the fact that both BS and RIS can be considered as 
large aperture antenna arrays , all three links tend to be in 
near -field communication . Therefore , beam training methods 
in near -field communication can be applied to extend the cov ⁃
erage of the communication and improve the signal -to-noise 
ratio (SNR) of the paths .
3.4.2 ISAC
ISAC , where both sensing and communication functional ⁃
ities share the same frequency bands and hardware , has 
emerged as a crucial technology for future wireless systems[31]. ▲Figure 5. Voting process in a scenario involving two BSs(b) (a)BS 1 BS 2 BS 1 BS 2
