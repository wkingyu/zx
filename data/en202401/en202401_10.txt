2) Near -field channel
As shown in Fig . 2, the NLoS channels in the near field ex ⁃
ist between the transmitter and the UE due to the presence of 
scatterers . Clearly , the NLoS channel can be divided into the 
combination of two MISO channels , i.e., the channel from the 
UE to the scatterer and the channel from the scatterer to the 
transmitter . Therefore , the NLoS channel can be decoupled as 
the product of two array response vectors :
Hnear
NLoS=∑
l=1L
βlaUE
near(rl)(aTR
near(rl))T,(8)
where βl and rl denote the channel coefficients for the l-th 
NLoS path and the location of the l-th scatterer , respectively . 
And the near -field array response vector aUE
near(rl) and aTR
near(rl) 
can be given by :
aUE
near(rl)=é

However , the LoS channel in the near field cannot be de ⁃
coupled as the product of two array response vectors . Specifi ⁃
cally , the LoS channel coefficient can be expressed as :
[Hnear
LoS]m,n=αm,ne-j2π
λrm,n=αm,ne-j2π
λ un-sm.(11)
Therefore , the overall near -field channel with multi -path 
components can be modeled as
Hnear=Hnear

2.2.2 MISO Channel Model Based on ULA Base Station
To more intuitively understand the properties of the near -
field channel , we next simplify it to the uniform linear array 
(ULA ) model .
We assume that the base station is equipped with Nt-ULA 
antennas and the user is equipped with a single antenna . In 
the case of ULA , we can ignore the z-axis and assume the loca ⁃
tions of the m-th antenna element of BS and UE as u=
[r0cosθ, r0sinθ]T and sm=[md, 0]T, ∀m=
-(Nt-1)2,⋯,(Nt-1)2, respectively , where d denotes 
spacing between two adjacent antenna elements . Therefore , the distance between the m-th antenna element of the transmit ⁃
ter and UE can be expressed as :
rm=u-sm=r02-2r0mdcosθ+m2d2
                            ≈(a)
r0-mdcosθ+m2d2sin2θ
2r0  . (13)
where (a) denotes the Taylor expansion approximation , which 
is also called the Fresnel approximation[24]. Then , the near -
field array response vector for the ULA channel is given by
anear
ULA(θ)=é

λ( )-(Nt-1)/2)dcosθ-(-(Nt-1)/2)2d2sin2θ

. (14)
For the far -field scenario , the distance rm can be approxi ⁃
mated as rm=r0-mdcosθ. Based on this , the far -field array 
response vector for the ULA channel can be expressed by :
afar
ULA(θ)=é
ëêêêêe-j2π
λ(-(Nt-1)/2)dcosθ),⋯, e-j2π
λ(Nt-1)/2)dcosθù

.(15)
Clearly , it can be observed from Eq . (14) that the phase of 
the near -field array response vector is not a linear function of 
m. However , for the far -field array response vector in Eq . (15), 
the phase is a linear function of m.
From the above derivation , it is evident that the far -field 
plane wave assumption will result in an obvious error in the 
practical near -field scenario . Moreover , the array response 
vectors in the near -field channel are more complex , posing 
challenges to conventional transmission scheme design and 
channel estimation .
2.3 Near -Field Channel with Spatial Non -Stationarity 
Property
In the near -field scenario , since the size of the transmitter ’s 
antenna array is significantly increased , spatial non -stationary 
properties[25–26] start to appear . Consequently , we introduce the 
concept of spatial non -stationarities and VRs based on the mod ⁃
eling of the near -field channel .
As illustrated in Fig. 3, spatial non -stationarities mean 
that due to the large array aperture , different parts of the an ⁃
tenna array could have different views of the propagation en ⁃
vironment . This property restricts the user to receiving only 
a portion of the signal transmitted by the antenna array , 
which is referred to as VR of the user . The VRs are formed 
primarily due to two reasons as follows[12]. 1) Unequal path 
loss: Based on the near -field channel , the increase in an ⁃
tenna array size makes it impossible to ignore the difference 
in path loss from different array elements to the user . Some 
of the array elements that are farther away from the user suf ⁃
