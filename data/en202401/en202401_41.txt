antennas , which is η≤ë û N-λδ, where N is the number of 
the antennas in the ULA with spacing δ. The same approach 
can be applied to the UPA , yielding a DOF of η≤

3 Numerical Simulations of DOF
3.1 ULA and UPA Configuration
We use the circuit model to analyze the DOF of ULA and 
UPA with mutual coupling under a Rayleigh scattering envi ⁃
ronment . The channel DOF is defined as the significant singu ⁃
lar values of the channel matrix . The configurations of ULA 
and UPA can be found in Fig . 3.
As shown in Fig . 3, the two tilt angles should meet β+
γ=π, where γ should avoid nπ/2 to make the tight -
coupled dipoles physically feasible . Note that the spacing δ, 
the tilt angle γ, and the distance D fully determine the ar ⁃
ray configuration .
When considering the NLoS scenario with the Rayleigh fad ⁃
ing model , the trans -impedance matrix can be given by

where α is the path loss parameter , and F is a small -scale fad ⁃
ing matrix with Fij~CN(0,1/2).
3.2 Numerical DOF Analysis
We define the rank of the channel matrix as the DOF of the 
system . We aim to investigate the DOF of the ULA and UPA communication system under various scenarios . These sce ⁃
narios consider the near -field and the far -field , the antenna 
spacing , and the distance between the Tx and Rx respec ⁃
tively . These scenarios are listed in Table 1 with indexes 1–
16. Note that we only change the antenna numbers in the 
transmitting array and fix the receiving ULA and UPA with 
16 half -wavelength antennas and 4×4 half -wavelength an ⁃
tennas respectively . To study the statistical properties of
