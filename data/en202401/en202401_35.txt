of distance , the error caused by the channel model mismatch 
tends towards 0, and the curves for LB and CRLB begin to co ⁃
incide , because the variation of the realistic channel model 
and the simplified channel model can be ignored when the 
transmitter is far from the c -subarray , and only little differ ⁃
ence exists between the spherical wave model and the planar 
wave model . However , if the distance is short , the channel 
model mismatch will significantly increase the LB . Therefore , 
ignoring the channel model mismatch will only result in a de ⁃
creased estimation performance .
In Fig . 5, the LB and CRLB are plotted against the num ⁃
ber of active elements at the c -subarray . In accordance with 
Eq. (15), while the CRLB of the pseudo -true AoA parameter 
tends towards 0 when the number of active elements at the c -
subarray grows to infinite , the accuracy of the estimated AoA 
parameter is still limited by the channel model mismatch and 
tends towards a non -zero constant . This verifies that the accu ⁃
racy of the estimated AoA parameter still has a non -zero lower 
bound even in communication systems with extremely large -
scale arrays . Hence , as the number of elements at the whole 
array increases , the channel model mismatch must be consid ⁃
ered to enhance the estimation accuracy and improve commu ⁃
nication performance .
Fig. 6 evaluates the SE of the proposed system with various 
array scale settings . The distance be ⁃
tween the transmitter and the XL -HRIS 
is r=5 m, and the AoA is θ=0.5. We 
can find that the obtained maximum SE , 
which considers the estimation error in 
real communication systems , is far lower 
than that of the perfect CSI scenario 
when the number of active elements at 
the c -subarray is small , because the un ⁃
avoidable error is caused by the channel 
model mismatch as Eq . (15). Fortunately , 
with the increase of the array scale of the 
c-subarray , a more accurate estimate of 
AoA can be obtained , as shown in Fig . 5, 
and thus the SE will be improved , which 
verifies the benefits of the extremely 
large -scale array for future 6G wireless 
communication systems . However , as the 
number of active elements at the c -
subarray grows to infinity , the obtained 
maximum SE is always lower than the SE 
with the prefect CSI . That is because , 
when the scale of the c -subarray is infi ⁃
nite, the LB of the estimated AoA tends 
towards a non -zero constant inversely 
proportional to r2 as Eq . (15), which can 
damage the SE of the proposed system 
when the distance between the transmit ⁃
ter and the XL -HRIS is short .5 Conclusions
In this paper , an XL -HRIS -aided system is introduced with 
a proposed near -field channel estimation algorithm . With the
