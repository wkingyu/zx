ers over 300 km weakly -coupled MRC -FMF has been experi ⁃
mentally demonstrated[9].
In addition to weakly -coupled FMF , the low -modal -
crosstalk MMUX/MDEMUX with low insertion loss (IL) and 
low -modal crosstalk is also a key component in the MDM 
transmission link[11]. Among various types of MMUXs and 
MDEMUXs , the one consisting of cascaded mode -selective 
couplers (MSCs ) is promising for weakly -coupled MDM sys ⁃
tems for its high conversion purity , high flexibility , and low 
coupling crosstalk with transmission FMFs[12–15]. MSCs with 
side -polishing processing have high modal selectivity and low 
IL because their waveguide structure is not significantly dam ⁃
aged during the fabrication process . Real -time transmissions 
utilizing the side -polishing MMUX/MDEMUX and small form -
factor pluggable plus (SFP+ ) optical modules have been ex ⁃
perimentally demonstrated[16–17].
In this paper , we adopt the side -polishing processing to de ⁃
sign and fabricate MSCs for a weakly -coupled triple -ring -core 
(TRC) FMF . A pair of all -fiber low -modal -crosstalk 4-mode 
MMUX/MDEMUX are completed by cascading side -polished 
MSCs . The measurement results show that a pair of MMUX/
MDEMUX and 25 km weakly -coupled TRC -FMF MDM link 
achieve low modal crosstalk of lower than −17.5 dB and inser ⁃
tion loss of lower than 11.56 dB for all the four modes . Based 
on the TRC -FMF and all -fiber MMUX/MDEMUX , a real -time 
4-mode 3-λ 25 km wavelength division multiplexing (WDM )-
MDM transmission is experimentally demonstrated using com ⁃
mercial 400G optical transport network (OTN ) transceivers .
2 TRC -FMF and MMUX/DEMUX
2.1 Weakly -Coupled TRC -FMF
Fig. 1 shows the designed (blue line ) and fabricated (orange 
line) index profile of the weakly -coupled TRC -FMF and neff of 
the supported four LP modes . This FMF is designed with a 
normalized frequency V of 4.8, and the refractive index differ ⁃ence between the core and cladding (Δn) is 0.6%. Three rings 
of index perturbations are applied into the fiber core to sepa ⁃
rate neff of different LP modes to suppress the distributed 
modal crosstalk among different LP modes in fiber transmis ⁃
sion. To reduce the bending sensitivity of high -order LP 
modes , a depressed -index fluorine -doped trench is applied in 
the cladding . The designed weakly -coupled TRC -FMF is fabri ⁃
cated using the plasma chemical vapor deposition (PCVD ) 
technique , which is widely used in commercial SMF fabrica ⁃
tion. Table 1 lists the measured characteristics of the four LP 
modes at 1 550 nm. A min| Δneff| up to 1.89 × 10−3 between dif ⁃
ferent LP modes is achieved , which can effectively suppress 
the modal crosstalk among them . The propagation loss (PL) of 
each LP mode is all lower than 0.227 dB/km thanks to the 
depressed -index trench .
2.2 Weakly -Coupled Side -Polishing MMUX/MDEMUX
MMUX and MDEMUX in this work are completed by cas ⁃
cading all -fiber side -polishing MSCs . The FMF of each MSC 
is the same as the transmission fiber , which can reduce the 
extra IL and modal crosstalk induced by mode field mis ⁃
matching at the connection point between the MMUX/
MDEMUX and FMF . For phase -matching with high -index 
LP01 and LP11 modes of the TRC -FMF , a customized step -
index SMF with a core/cladding radius of 2.48/62.5 μm and 
Δn of 1.23% at 1 550 nm is adopted . The designed (blue line ) 
and measured (orange line ) index profiles are shown in Fig . 2,
