Eqs. (26)–(28) represent the IL of the filter in the high , 
medium and low frequency bands , respectively . According 
to Eq . (27), the IL of the first -order π-type filter in the con ⁃
duction band is mainly determined by Eq . (26) with a slope 
of 40 dB/dec .
After the IL of the first -order π-type filter is determined , 
the IL required to pass the EMI test is obtained by comparing 
the original noise spectrum with the EMI standard limits , as 
shown in Eq . (29):
IL=RAW NOISE-LIMIT+MARGIN. (29)
Fig. 20(a) shows the original CM noise spectrum measured 
by the current method , and the unit used in the EN 55032  stan ⁃
dard is dB μV. The current is thus converted into a voltage 
quantity , and the conversion relationship is as follows :
20log|Ucm|=20log|Icm⋅Rcm|≈20log|Icm|+28 dB .(30)The CM noise voltage spectrum after con ⁃
version is obtained according to Eq . (30), as 
shown in Fig . 20(b).
According to EN 55032  CLASS B , the 
bare noise of the prototype is subtracted 
from the EMI standard limit , and the differ ⁃
ence spectrum between the noise and the 
limit is obtained as shown in Fig . 21, and 
the difference is the minimum IL required .
In Fig . 21, fT_cm indicates the frequency of 
ILcm1 and the tangent point of the required 
IL, and ILT_cm corresponding to the tangent 
point indicates the minimum CM IL required 
by the prototype . According to Fig . 21, the 
minimum CM IL required by the prototype 
can be determined to be about 21.798 dB, 
while the IL of the actual filter design needs 
to be greater than this value to ensure the fil ⁃
ter margin of the actual filter . To ensure that 
the filter has sufficient filtering effect , the fil ⁃
ter insertion loss ILcm is 40 dB. Based on the 
slope , the turning frequency of the curve fc_cm 
is obtained as follows :
fc_cm=10-ILcm
40⋅fT_cm≈23.4 kHz . (31)
