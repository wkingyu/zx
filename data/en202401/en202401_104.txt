tion point of the trace of the two solution sets is the solution to 
the two equations .
According to the calculation , combined with the program 
written by Mathcad , the source impedance of the noise source 
is solved , and the results are shown in Fig . 13.
As shown in Fig . 13, the source impedance of the prototype 
is capacitive in the middle and low frequency bands of the 
conduction band and sensitive in the high frequency band . 
Therefore , the high -frequency equivalent capacitance model 
can be used to characterize the internal impedance character ⁃
istics of the noise source .
The corresponding source impedance expression is shown 
as follows :
Zs=Rs+1
jωCs+jωLs . (20)
The circuit parameters are obtained by mathematical fit ⁃
ting: Rs=0.011 Ω, Cs=41.6 nF, and Ls=18.7 nH. The fitting re ⁃
sults for the circuit parameters are shown in Fig . 14.
According to Fig . 14, source impedance is approximately 
capacitive in the range of 150 kHz to 5.7 MHz . In the range of 
5.7 MHz to 30 MHz , the internal impedance of the CM noise 
source is approximately inductive .
In order to verify the accuracy of the insertion -loss method 
to extract the internal impedance of the noise source , the Y ca⁃
pacitors of 220 nF and 470 nF were connected to the proto ⁃type respectively , and the corresponding CM noise spectrum 
was measured experimentally . The result is shown in Fig . 15.
In Fig . 15, the red curve is the CM noise spectrum mea ⁃
sured when the Y capacitor is connected , and the blue curve 
is the CM noise spectrum calculated by the insertion -loss 
method . This experiment verifies the accuracy of insertion -
loss method in extracting the source impedance parameters of 
the noise source .
5 Impedance Mismatch Principle
When impedance is matched , the signal can be transmitted 
efficiently and completely . For filters , impedance mismatch 
must be made . The transmission efficiency of the interference 
signal is the lowest when impedance is mismatched . Taking 
Fig. 16 for example , mismatch is achieved by adjusting the 
values of Z1 and Z2 to adjust voltage distribution . The voltage 
U2 assigned to Z2 is:
U2=UZ2
Z1+Z2 . (21)
