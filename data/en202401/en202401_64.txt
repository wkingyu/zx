March  2024  Vol.22 No.1CAO Xinghan , YIN Huarui , YOU Changsheng Special Topic   Near -Field Wireless Power Transfer , Sensing and Communication with Bessel Beams
rently , the research is primarily focused on their interference re ⁃
sistance in FSO communication . In other high -frequency ranges , 
such as terahertz and millimeter waves , as well as under near -
field conditions , the excellent directionality and self -healing 
characteristics of Bessel beams have the potential to achieve 
high -speed and stable transmission links with the ability to pen ⁃
etrate obstacles , making them a promising alternative technology 
for beamforming or beam focusing . However , research in these 
aspects is still relatively lacking . Finally , designing Bessel beam 
generation devices that meet practical application requirements 
is an inevitable challenge in their applied research .
5 Conclusions
This paper provides a comprehensive review of the Bessel 
beam concept and the research related to it . Starting from the 
scalar wave theory , we introduce the properties and fundamental 
theory of Bessel beams . The current focus of research on Bessel 
beams is their generation , with some exploration of their applica ⁃
tions. The generation methods are categorized into two types : 
based on the scalar wave theory and based on the vector wave 
theory . We also review the current implementations of Bessel 
beam generation and explore their applications from the per ⁃
spectives of wireless power transfer , sensing , and communica ⁃
tion. In conclusion , Bessel beams require a more precise de ⁃
scription and study of their properties through near -field theo ⁃
ries, akin to the challenges faced in traditional communication 
and sensing in the near -field region . Simultaneously , the appli ⁃
cation of Bessel beams imposes higher requirements on the pre ⁃
cise phase modulation capability and integration of emitting de ⁃
vices , introducing new challenges and opportunities for beam ⁃
forming and antenna design . In the future , the enormous appli ⁃
cation potential of Bessel beams is expected to be further ex ⁃
plored in higher communication frequency bands and shorter -
distance scenarios .
