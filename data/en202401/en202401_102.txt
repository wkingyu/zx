In Eqs . (7) and (8), IL1, IL2 and IL3 are measured , and the 
value of inserting impedance Zinsert is known . Zs is the source 
impedance of the noise source that needs to be extracted , 
which is divided into real parts and imaginary parts :
Zs=a+j⋅b . (9)
A system of two quadratic equations is obtained :

For the convenience of the experiment , three sets of Y ca⁃
pacitors : 22 nF, 47 nF and 100 nF, were selected as the insert ⁃
ing impedance . Before the insertion -loss method experiment , 
the impedance characteristic curves of the three groups of Y 
capacitors were measured , and the measured impedance 
curves were shown in Fig . 9.
The high -frequency model of the capacitor is connected in 
series through the capacitor , parasitic inductance , and para ⁃
sitic resistance . These three values can be calculated through 
numerical fitting .
When two Y capacitors are inserted between the device un ⁃
der test (DUT ) and LISN , there are two parallel Cy in the CM 
loop, and their equivalent impedance Zc=1/(j2ωCy). The 
equivalent circuit is shown in Fig . 10.
CM noise current Icm in Fig . 10 can be obtained :
Icm=Ucm
Rcm=Rcm⋅Zc

Three sets of Y capacitors were connected to the prototype , 
and the CM noise spectrum was measured to obtain the inser ⁃
tion loss , as shown in Fig . 11.
The conducted CM noise current spectrum obtained by mea ⁃
surement needs to be converted into amplitudes , and the con ⁃
version relationship is as follows :ICM_LISN=20log(iL+iN), (12)
where ICM_LISN  represents the amplitude of the current through 
LISN , and iL and iN represent the actual noise current through 
L-line and N-line flowing through resistance RLISN respec ⁃
tively . The CM noise current flowing through the source im ⁃
pedance Zs of the noise source is defined as iCM, as shown in 
Fig. 12(a).

By connecting Eq . (12) with Eq . (13), the actual CM noise 
current Icm is obtained . In each group of noise measurements , 
RLISN and Cy are known values , which are defined as Zload. The 
Zload in Fig . 12(b) is:
