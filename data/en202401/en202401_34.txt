Hence , in the scenario θ=1, the estimation error lower 
bound will tend towards 0 when the transmitted signal power 
or the number of active elements at the c -subarray is infinite , 
and different from Eq . (15), the LB is independent of the dis ⁃
tance parameter .
Then , the received SNR at the BS , which considers the esti ⁃
mation errors , can be rewritten as
SNRrec=P  ŵH
recHBSΩhR2
σ2 , (41)
where the receiver can be denoted as
ŵrec=ĝHBSΩwR( ) θ+Δθmin, r+Δrmin
||ĝ  HBSΩwR( ) θ+Δθmin, r+Δrmin, (42)
in which the complex gain ĝ can be calculated through the LS 
method as
ĝ=[ ]ŵH
sub, ŵH
ran[ ]yH

, (43)
where ŵsub=wsub(θ+Δθmin, r+Δrmin) and ŵran=wran(θ+
Δθmin, r+Δrmin), respectively . Hence , the existence of chan ⁃
nel model mismatch will increase the AoA parameter estima ⁃
tion error and thus damage the SE of the communication sys ⁃
tem, even in the scenario where the number of active elements 
at the c -subarray is infinite . Note that when the distance be ⁃
tween the transmitter and the XL -HRIS is short , a lower 
CRLB of the estimated AoA parameter can be obtained , and 
the SE will further decrease .
4 Simulation Results
In this section , we evaluate the impacts of the channel 
model mismatch on the AoA parameter estimation error lower 
bound , as well as the impacts of the scale array on both the pa ⁃
rameter estimation accuracy and communication performance 
of the proposed XL -HRIS -aided system . The parameters of the 
proposed system are set as follows : the carrier frequency is fc=
30 GHz ; the XL -HRIS has N=1 024 elements ; the c -
subarray has Nsub=64 active elements while the r -subarray 
has Nran=64 active elements ; the SNR is set as 10 dB, and 
the angle and distance are randomly generated within 
θ∈)[0, 2π and r∈(10, 50) meters , respectively .
The LB of the AoA parameter is evaluated first as shown in 
Figs. 3, 4 and 5, where the distance between the transmitter 
and the center of the ULA is set as 3 m, and the azimuth angle 
is set as π4. In Fig . 3, the LB of the AoA parameter and the 
CRLB of the pseudo -true AoA parameter with the SNR are 
highlighted . It is observed that the channel model mismatch 
leads to an increase in the parameter estimation LB , which fur ⁃ther decreases the estimation accuracy of channel estimation . 
With the increase of SNR , the CRLB of the pseudo -true pa ⁃
rameter tends towards 0, but the LB approaches a non -zero 
constant , which demonstrates that the estimation error caused 
by the channel model mismatch will not disappear even the 
transmitted power is infinite . Hence , for the parameter estima ⁃
tion algorithm based on the planar wave channel model , fur⁃
ther increased power will not bring significant performance im ⁃
provement if the transmitted power exceeds a threshold ,.
In Fig . 4, the LB and CRLB are plotted against the distance 
between the transmitter and the XL -HRIS . With the increase
