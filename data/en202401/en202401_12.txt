3.1.2 Existing Works
Similar to far -field beam training , near -field beam training 
can be accomplished using both traditional and machine 
learning -based methods , with beam sweeping and hierarchical 
beam training[35].
The most straightforward way for codebook -based near -field 
beam training is beam sweeping ; however , this approach intro ⁃
duces unacceptable pilot overhead due to the expansion of the 
codebook dimension . To tackle this problem , researchers de ⁃
signed a hierarchical beam training scheme based on a hierar ⁃
chical near -field codebook , which reduces the pilot over ⁃
head[36]. Furthermore , the authors of Ref . [24] designed a 
polar -domain near -field codebook in which the angular do ⁃
main was uniformly sampled while the distance was sampled 
as inhomogeneous distance rings as shown in Fig . 4(b). By uti ⁃
lizing the polar -domain near -field codebook , the authors in 
Ref. [37] proposed a new two -phase beam training method . 
Specifically , beam training is accomplished by angular do ⁃
main sweeping based on a far -field codebook and distance 
sweeping based on a polar -domain near -field codebook , re⁃
spectively , which significantly reduces the training overheads . 
Nevertheless , the necessary pilot overhead remains excessive , 
and the impact of noise on the hierarchical beam training 
scheme cannot be neglected . Deep learning constitutes a sub ⁃
division of machine learning that relies on artificial neural net ⁃
works to emulate and acquire intricate data representations 
and features through multi -layer neural network architectures . 
It gradually abstracts high -level features and representations 
in the input data through multi -layer nonlinear transforma ⁃
tions to enable learning and reasoning about complex tasks . 
Recently , deep learning has been widely used in wireless com ⁃
munication to reduce the cost of beam training[34, 38–41]. The au ⁃
thors of Ref . [34] took the received signals corresponding to a 
few beams as the input for deep neural networks (DNN ) to esti ⁃
mate the beam that best matches the channel . Ref. [34] intro ⁃
duced a DNN -based method with location information to re ⁃
duce beam training overhead . Inspired by the above work , the 
authors of Refs . [38–41] have extended 
the deep learning method to near -field 
beam training . The authors of Ref . [38] 
used a part of the near -field beam as the 
input of DNN for prediction . By contrast , 
Ref. [40] utilized the information of far -
field wide beam as the input of the deep 
learning network to predict the optimal 
beam to reduce the overhead . In the fol ⁃
lowing part , we present more details of 
the research work in Ref . [40].
3.1.3 Near -Field Beam Training Based 
on Deep Learning
A well -trained deep learning approach 
is used in Ref . [40] to uncover the angle and distance information carried by the far -field wide beam to 
find the optimal near -field codeword . Specifically , the authors 
constructed the neural network structure shown in Fig. 5 for 
the angle and distance domains , respectively . The deep 
learning -based near -field beam training problem can be formu ⁃
lated as :
n*=f1(yw), n*∈{1,2,⋯,N}, (18)
s*=f2(yw), s*∈{1,2,⋯,S}, (19)
where yw is received signals of the far -field wide beams . n*and 
s* denote the optimal angle and ring indices in the polar do ⁃
main , respectively .
The input of the neural network is the real and imaginary 
part of yw, which is transformed into a matrix form , respec ⁃
tively . Then with carefully designed convolutional and fully 
connected layers , the final output can be written as :
P̂a=[p̂a
1, p̂a
2,⋯, p̂a
N]T, P̂r=[p̂r
1, p̂r
2,⋯, p̂r
S]T, (20)
where p̂a
n and p̂r
s denote the estimated probability of the optimal 
angle and ring indices , respectively . The authors determine 
the index corresponding to the angle and distance under the 
polar -domain codebook by finding the maximum estimated 
probability in P̂a and P̂r to achieve the optimal beam . In addi ⁃
tion, the authors offer an improved scheme , in which it per ⁃
forms additional tests by obtaining K maximum possible angle 
indices and L maximum possible distance indices in P̂a and 
P̂r. It can be formulated as :
{p̂a
σ1, p̂a
σ2,⋯, p̂a
σN}={ } p̂a
1, p̂a
2,⋯, p̂a
