Abstract : Extremely large -scale hybrid reconfigurable intelligence surface (XL-HRIS ), an improved version of the RIS , can receive the inci ⁃
dent signal and enhance communication performance . However , as the RIS size increases , the phase variations of the received signal across 
the whole array are nonnegligible in the near -field region , and the channel model mismatch , which will decrease the estimation accuracy , 
must be considered . In this paper , the lower bound (LB) of the estimated parameter is studied and the impacts of the distance and signal -to-
noise ratio (SNR) on LB are then evaluated . Moreover , the impacts of the array scale on LB and spectral efficiency (SE) are also studied . Simu ⁃
lation results verify that even in extremely large -scale array systems with infinite SNR , channel model mismatch can still limit estimation ac ⁃
curacy . However , this impact decreases with increasing distance .

1 Introduction
Reconfigurable intelligence surface (RIS) is a candidate 
enabling technology for future 6G wireless communica ⁃
tion systems[1]. It can increase the spectral efficiency 
(SE) through reconfiguring the communication environ ⁃
ment with low hardware cost and little consumption[2–4]. To in ⁃
crease the SE of the communication systems , the phase shift of 
each element at the RIS should be devised specifically , which 
requires the acquisition of channel state information (CSI) in ad ⁃
vance . However , for the passive RIS[5–13] that is composed of 
nearly passive elements , only the cascade channel between the 
transmitter and the receiver can be estimated , leading to high 
computational complexity and high pilot overhead that is equal 
to the number of elements at the RIS . CSI of the two separate 
channels (i.e., the channel between the user equipment (UE) 
and the RIS and that between the RIS and the BS ) cannot be 
utilized directly to enhance communication performance . 
Hence , the hybrid RIS (HRIS ), which is composed of both pas ⁃sive and active elements , has been proposed to estimate the CSI 
in separate channels . The passive elements can only reflect the 
signal with a programmable phase shift , while the active ele ⁃
ments can also process the receive signal[14–18]. Many studies 
have been conducted on channel estimation for HRIS -aided sys ⁃
tems[19–21]. The authors of Ref . [19] proposed a two -stage chan ⁃
nel estimation scheme , in which the HRIS estimated the chan ⁃
nel between the UE and the HRIS firstly , followed by the BS es ⁃
timating the channel between the HRIS and the BS . In Ref . 
[20], the UE and the BS transmitted pilots to the HRIS , respec ⁃
tively , and then the HRIS estimated the two separate channels . 
In Ref . [21], the HRIS was equipped with only one single RF 
chain , which enabled the estimation of the two separate chan ⁃
nels with low hardware cost .
However , as more elements are employed in the HRIS , it 
becomes necessary to consider extremely large -scale HRIS 
(XL-HRIS ) aided systems for further 6G wireless communica ⁃
tion systems . When the aperture of the array is large , the 
phase variations of the receive signal among the whole array 
cannot be ignored , and the channel should be modeled by the 
spherical -wave model . This will lead to high computational 
complexity for channel estimation , because the high -
dimension channel vector and the emerging distance param ⁃
eter need to be considered in the near -field region[22–29]. Espe ⁃
