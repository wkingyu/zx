Abstract : Extremely large -scale multiple -input multiple -output (XL-MIMO ) and terahertz (THz) communications are pivotal candidate tech ⁃
nologies for supporting the development of 6G mobile networks . However , these techniques invalidate the common assumptions of far -field 
plane waves and introduce many new properties . To accurately understand the performance of these new techniques , spherical wave modeling 
of near -field communications needs to be applied for future research . Hence , the investigation of near -field communication holds significant 
importance for the advancement of 6G, which brings many new and open research challenges in contrast to conventional far -field communica ⁃
tion. In this paper , we first formulate a general model of the near -field channel and discuss the influence of spatial nonstationary properties on 
the near -field channel modeling . Subsequently , we discuss the challenges encountered in the near field in terms of beam training , localiza ⁃
tion, and transmission scheme design , respectively . Finally , we point out some promising research directions for near -field communications .
Keywords : near -field communications ; extremely large -scale antenna arrays ; spatial non -stationarity ; beam training ; localization

1 Introduction
The advent of the 5G wireless network marks the incep ⁃
tion of an era characterized by high speed , low la ⁃
tency , and robust connectivity[1–4]. Millimeter waves 
(mmWave ) and various key technologies like massive 
multiple -input multiple -output (MIMO ) have contributed sig ⁃
nificantly to the success of 5G, particularly in areas such as 
smart cities and the Internet of Things (IoT)[5–7]. Although 5G 
has achieved remarkable results , it still faces limitations in ad ⁃
dressing diverse and complex business scenarios , including 
virtual reality , driverless vehicles and metaverse[8]. These 
emerging scenarios impose greater demands on the network 
capacity , prompting researchers to explore 6G wireless net ⁃
works , which will further surpass the limits of the current tech ⁃
nologies to meet much more complex communication needs[9].
In contrast to 5G, 6G has the potential to deliver higher 
communication rates , ultra -reliable and low latency communi ⁃cations (URLLC ), and ubiquitous coverage[10–11]. In order to 
achieve these goals for 6G, some technologies considered 
promising for 6G have attracted significant attention , such as 
extremely large -scale MIMO (XL-MIMO ) and Terahertz (THz) 
communications[12]. Specifically , XL -MIMO can realize ultra -
high network throughput and support a large number of users 
by further increasing the number of antennas on massive 
MIMO . Meanwhile , emerging technologies like reconfigurable 
intelligent surface (RIS) and artificial intelligence (AI) tech ⁃
niques empower XL -MIMO to attain increased spectral effi ⁃
ciency , enhanced positioning accuracy , and broader network 
coverage across a more diverse frequency range . Also , THz 
communications , with its capacity to exploit richer spectrum 
resources for enhanced data transmission rates , is a key candi ⁃
date spectrum technology with significant potential .
However , the new technologies in 6G, e.g., THz communica ⁃
tions and XL -MIMO , also lead to operating frequency band es ⁃
calation and antenna array aperture expansion . As a result , 
Rayleigh distance , the crucial parameter , that distinguishes 
between the near -field and far -field boundaries of electromag ⁃
netic (EM) wave propagation changes significantly[12]. For ex ⁃
ample , Ref. [13] gave the Rayleigh distances corresponding to 
different array apertures , where the near -field range corre ⁃
sponding to an array of 0.5 m aperture was already as high as
