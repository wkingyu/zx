where gequ=Pg is thought as constant . However , in the pro ⁃
posed channel estimation algorithm , the channel between the 
UE and the c -subarray is simplified as Eq . (8) for estimating 
the AoA parameter from the receive signal of the c -subarray , 
which can be expressed as
ysub≈Pgasim(θ)+zsub, (12)

channel model can be expressed as

When the distance between the UE and XL -HRIS is far or 
the array scale of the c -subarray is small , the variation among 
the realistic and simplified channel models can be ignored , 
and the Cramer -Rao lower bound (CRLB ) of the estimated 
AoA parameter can be directly derived based on Eq . (13). 
Nevertheless , with the increase of the scale of the c -subarray 
in the proposed XL -HRIS -aided systems , the phase variations 
among the whole array become large . Then , the estimation of θ 
based on the simplified model in Eq . (13) will face accuracy 
degradation due to the non -negligible variation between the 
simplified model and the realistic model . Hence , the LB of the 
estimated AoA parameter , which considers the channel model 
mismatch , should be studied to get a more accurate estimation 
error lower bound .
3.2 LB of Estimated AoA Parameter
To obtain the LB of the estimated AoA parameter , the chan ⁃
nel model mismatch must be considered . Firstly , we recall the 
estimation lower bound derivation based on the pseudo -true 
parameter ηpse when the model mismatch happens[34]. The 
pseudo -true parameter can minimize the Kullback -Leibler 
(KL) divergence between the true probability density function 
with the true parameter ηˉ and the mismatched probability den ⁃
sity function with the pseudo -true parameter ηpse. Then , the 
Preliminary 1 can be obtained :
Preliminary 1: When model mismatch happens , a pseudo -
true parameter ηpse can be estimated firstly , and the LB of the 
estimated parameter ηˉ can be expressed as
LB(ηˉ)=CRLB(ηpse)+(ηˉ-ηpse)H(ηˉ-ηpse), (14)where CRLB(ηpse) denotes the CRLB of the estimated pseudo -
true parameter ηpse under the mismatched model .
Based on Preliminary 1, the LB of the estimated AoA pa ⁃
rameter under the channel model mismatch can be given by 
Theorem 1.
Theorem 1: When estimating the AoA parameter from the 
realistic receive signal based on the planar wave model , the 
LB of the estimated AoA parameter can be expressed as

Proof : Let {θˉ, rˉ} denote the true channel parameters , and 
the pseudo -true parameter is defined as
θpse=argmin
θ∈)[0, 2πD(p(ysub|{θˉ, rˉ})||p͂(ysub|θ)), (16)
where D(p(ysub|{θˉ, rˉ})||p͂(ysub|θ)) denotes the KL divergence 
between the distributions p(ysub|{θˉ, rˉ}) and p͂(ysub|θ). Since θ̂ 
is an unbiased estimate of θpse, i.e., E{θ̂}=θpse, the CRLB of 
the unbiased estimate can be denoted as
Ep{(θ̂-θpse)2}≥CRLB(θpse), (17)
where Ep{⋅} denotes taking the expectation operation , and 
CRLB(θpse) is CRLB of the pseudo -true parameter θpse, which 
can be calculated as
CRLB(θpse)=FIM-1()θpse. (18)
The Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) FIM(θpse) can be cal ⁃
