due to the massive elements . Therefore , it is valuable to de ⁃

and pilot overhead .
4.3 Near -Field Behavior of XL -Array
As one of the main innovations of 6G wireless communica ⁃
tions , the successful application of XL -MIMO depends on the 
investigation and understanding of the near -field propagation . 
In addition , it is valuable to study the physically accurate 
near -field propagation model of XL -arrays .
Specifically , the near -field EM channel model proposed in 
Ref. [60] accurately depicts the physical EM wave transmis ⁃
sion in the near -field scenario , which can be utilized to ana ⁃
lyze the impact of discrete array aperture and polarization 
mismatch . Nevertheless , the physical channel model in Ref . 
[60] is totally based on theoretical analysis with Maxwell ’s 
EM field theory , so it is also meaningful to carry out channel 
measurements to verify and modify the near -field EM chan ⁃
nel model .
Moreover , the authors in Ref . [58–60] utilized the infor ⁃
mation of VRs to remove the elements of the antenna array 
that contributed less to the signal transmission , and con ⁃
structed equivalent dimensionality reduction channels to re ⁃
duce the computational complexity . However , how to accu ⁃
rately measure VR using channel estimation methods is still 
an open question .
5 Conclusions
The far -field assumptions tend to be invalid owing to the 
large array size and short wavelength in 6G wireless commu ⁃
nications . Hence , the near -field effect and spherical wave ⁃
front are no longer dispensable in some envisioned 6G sce ⁃
narios . In this paper , we discussed the challenges and oppor ⁃
tunities of near -field communication in terms of the funda ⁃
mentals and applications in various schemes . We first intro ⁃
duced the three regions of free -space propagation and the 
corresponding wavefronts , with an emphasis on the radiating 
near -field and spherical wavefront . Then , we derived the 
near -field MIMO channel model and discussed the impact of 
spatial non -stationarity property on near -field propagation . 
In addition , we introduced several appealing works with re ⁃
spect to beam training and localization in the near -field sce ⁃
narios and a recent work exploiting the spatial non -
stationarity in the near field to achieve low -complexity trans ⁃
mission design . Finally , some insights into the future im ⁃
provements of near -field communication were discussed .
