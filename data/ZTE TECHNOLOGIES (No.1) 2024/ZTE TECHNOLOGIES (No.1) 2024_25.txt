capabilities has limited UL coverage compared to 
existing eMBB terminals, ZTE supports multiple 
uplink coverage enhancement functions such as 
Joint Channel Estimation to improve the uplink 
coverage capability of RedCap terminals and ensure 
that the edge rate of 5G RedCap meets the service 
demand. For power saving, considering the service 
characteristics of some 5G RedCap application 
scenarios, such as multiple small-packet data 
transmissions from wearable devices, ZTE supports 
the small packet transmission (SDT) feature, which 
reduces signaling overhead and extends the battery 
standby time of terminals. 
RedCap + X enables 5G RedCap to provide extreme 
performance guarantee for targeted applications, 
ensuring the ful/f_illment of service requirements. ZTE 
supports the customization of application-oriented 
RedCap network capabilities to meet the diverse 
needs of diﬀerent vertical industries. For instance, 
RedCap + Slicing is provided to ensure isolation 
between control services and management services, 
which is mandatory for the power grid scenario. 
RedCap + High Precision Time Synchronization can 
also be supported for the control services in the 
power grid. RedCap + NodeEngine provides base 
station-based edge computing power for the 
campus, applicable in AI-based video surveillance 
scenarios. RedCap + uRLLC enables the 
implementation of remote control in smart factory 
while RedCap + VoNR faciliates high-de/f_inition video 
calls for wearables.
ZTE Achievements in 5G RedCap 
Veri/f_ication and Application
Since the freeze of 3GPP Release 17 in 2022, which 
speci/f_ies 5G RedCap, ZTE has actively participated in 
promoting the commercial use of 5G RedCap with 
industry partners, encompassing completing research 
and veri/f_ication of 5G RedCap technology, accelerating 
the maturity of the industry chain, and deploying 
multiple industry pilots. 
In collaboration with four Chinese operators, ZTE has 
completed 5G RedCap veri/f_ication at all the 5G 
frequency bands and using multiple bandwidths. 
Diverse networking scenarios, including RAN Sharing 
and DSS, have been veri/f_ied. From lab technical veri/f_ication to performance tests in commercial 5G 
networks, the feasibility of RedCap in existing 
commercial 5G networks has been proved through 
full-scenario veri/f_ication, laying the foundation for its 
commercial deployment. In Thailand, ZTE, in 
collaboration with AIS, accomplished the /f_irst 
collaborative validation of 5G RedCap at 2.6 GHz in 
Southeast Asia. The test outcomes consistently 
achieved theoretical peak values for single-user 
throughput. In addition, RedCap + NodeEngine was 
veri/f_ied, showcasing the capability to provide users 
with an end-to-end low latency of about 10 ms. 
As for real industry scenarios, ZTE, with the 
industrial partner Brunp Recycling Co., Ltd. Cycle, has 
completed RedCap veri/f_ication in a smart 
manufacturing factory, proving that RedCap 
terminals, with reduced cost and reduced power 
consumption, can meet the application criteria of 
typical services in the manufacturing scenario. ZTE 
has also completed RedCap pilots in the power grid 
and security industries, including the veri/f_ication of 
power distribution automation services in the smart 
grid and high-de/f_inition video surveillance in the 
campus security scenario, demonstrating RedCap’s 
applicability in various vertical industries. 
To accelerate the maturity of 5G RedCap 
ecosystem, ZTE has completed interconnection 
veri/f_ication between the 5G network and the 5G 
RedCap terminal side. Partners included mainstream 
chipset vendors like Qualcomm, MTK, UniSOC and 
mainstream module vendors such as QUECTEL and 
China Mobile IoT. The veri/f_ication tests were 
conducted using commercial 5G networks and 
pre-commercial chipsets and modules. This has 
proved the compatibility between existing 5G 
networks and RedCap terminals, advancing the 
maturity of the RedCap industry chain. 
As a highly cost-eﬀective IoT solution, 5G RedCap 
provides a superior choice for  mass-scale IoT growth 
and holds the potential to become the basic 
technology for digital transformation. ZTE is 
committed to promoting the commercial deployment 
and application of RedCap. Moving forward, ZTE will 
continue to collaborate with industry partners to drive 
5G RedCap innovation, explore additional 
applications, and oﬀer more convenient and eﬃcient 
communication experiences.
