transformation.
Real Impact and Future Prospects
The practical impact of ZTE 5G NTN solution is 
demonstrated through its successful deployments in 
a variety of scenarios. By providing stable and 
high-quality connectivity, ZTE is helping to break 
down barriers that have hindered the progress of 
remote regions. Moreover, as economies of scale 
materialize, the cost of satellite connections is 
expected to decline further, expanding the 
commercial prospects and market potential for 5G 
NTN technology. This represents a pivotal direction 
for the future of the telecom industry and its 
evolution towards 6G. 
ZTE, positioned at the forefront of this 
transformation, is driving innovation to achieve more 
seamless, rapid, and universal connectivity. The 
company’s commitment to research in this /f_ield 
underscores its determination to maintain a leading 
position in the telecom industry, ensuring that its 
solutions remain at the cutting edge. As 5G NTN is 
increasingly adopted and implemented, it is 
reasonable to anticipate a world where information 
exchange /f_lows more freely, and every corner of the 
planet enjoys access to equal and eﬃcient 
communication services.practicality and reliability of 5G NTN technology and 
solidifying the foundation for the commercial 
application of direct-to-satellite smartphone 
technology.
In September 2023, ZTE’s collaboration with China 
Mobile marked another signi/f_icant achievement with 
the successful completion of the /f_irst domestic 
operator-led NR-NTN low-earth-orbit satellite 
broadband service laboratory trial. This success not 
only showcased technological prowess but also 
hinted at the expansive future applications of 5G 
NR-NTN technology.
Also, in September 2023, ZTE and China Telecom 
/f_inished a maritime scenario trial of 5G NTN 
technology, achieving successful interaction and 
data transmission via on-orbit geostationary satellite 
in sea and uninhabited island scenarios. The trial, 
which involved real-time business veri/f_ication in 
multiple terminals and scenarios like ocean water 
quality monitoring and emergency rescue on 
uninhabited islands, demonstrated the eﬀectiveness 
and reliability of 5G NTN in complex environments.
In November, in collaboration with China Unicom, 
ZTE completed the /f_irst laboratory trial of 3GPP NR 
NTN low-earth-orbit satellite voice and video calls, 
laying the foundation for the deployment of 
integrated satellite-terrestrial network applications. 
This series of veri/f_ications and experiments is not 
only a testament to technological innovation but also 
reinforces ZTE’s leadership in the global 5G NTN 
sphere. As these technologies continue to mature
