ZTE Dynamic RIS: Towards 
Cost-Eﬃcient and Sustainable 
5G-Advanced and Beyond
Challenges Facing 5G-Advanced 
and Beyond
s 5G commercialization gains 
momentum, active exploration 
of 5G-Advanced and 6G 
communication systems is
underway. Nevertheless, the industry faces challenges 
on this evolutionary journey. Traditional network 
deployment proves inadequate for seamless 
coverage due to the assumption of an uncontrollable 
wireless environment, and the construction cost 
and energy consumption remain notably high. The 
advent of 5G-Advanced and future communication 
systems introduces new and demanding services, 
such as high-speed, low-latency applications (e.g., 
mixed reality, holographic rendering, sensing, 
and wireless medical services), creating a notable 
contradiction between service capacity requirements 
and limited spectrum resources.
While 5G continues to dominate headlines, 
the telecom industry is already focusing on 
technological advancements beyond the 5G 
era. Recon/f_igurable intelligent surface (RIS) has 
emerged as a robust contender for 5G-Advanced Aand 6G mobile networks, gaining global attention 
from academia and industry stakeholders. 
RIS: A Novel Form of Antennas for 
Next-Generation Networks 
RIS stands out as a cutting-edge and promising 
technology, poised for commercial success in 
5G-Advanced and 6G. This innovation oﬀers enhanced 
performance, cost-eﬀectiveness, easy deployment, 
and low-carbon networks, playing a pivotal role in the 
cost-eﬃcient and sustainable evolution of 5G-Advanced 
and beyond. The fundamental principle of RIS lies in 
creating an intelligent and adaptable environment 
through digital programming, manipulating the 
electromagnetic properties of metamaterials for 
unparalleled /f_lexibility.
In contrast to conventional materials following 
Snell’s Law, which dictates that the angles of re/f_lection 
and incidence signals remain equal and unalterable, 
RIS leverages electromagnetic (EM) metamaterials to 
precisely control the direction, width, and quantity of EM 
waves, facilitating accurate re/f_lection or penetration.
