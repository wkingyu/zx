has not only enhanced evaluation eﬃciency 
and accuracy but also expedited the 
development of the entire XR industry chain. 
The evaluation system covers media quality, 
interactive quality, and display quality. Key 
evaluation factors include the realism of VR 
audio, video, and freedom of movement, user 
susceptibility to dizziness, as well as the 
occurrence of issues like screen distortion and 
video stuttering during playback. Moreover, ZTE 
has pioneered the incorporation of digital twin 
technology in the industry by establishing a 
digital twin simulation platform. This platform 
serves as the industry’s /f_irst XR experience 
evaluation system integrating digital twin 
technology. The twin platform eﬃciently 
collects and processes data, analyzes service 
features, and iteratively optimizes evaluation 
algorithms, contributing to a signi/f_icant 
enhancement in the accuracy of the evaluation 
system.
Cloud Rendering and Computing Power Base 
Station: Creating Ultimate User Experience
The current processing capability of 
terminals falls short of the demands for 
complete immersion, and the existing network 
architecture fails to meet the low-latency 
requirements essential for robust interactive XR 
services. A standout feature of the X-Edge 
solution lies in the pioneering introduction of 
an industry-exclusive cloud rendering and 
computing power base station. This innovation 
facilitates precise identi/f_ication of XR services, 
ensuring the prioritized scheduling of these 
services. Notably, the rendering function is 
shifted from the terminal to the base station, 
resulting in a reduction in both power 
consumption and terminal complexity. This 
strategic oﬄoading enhances the overall 
eﬃciency and performance of XR services. 
Eﬃcient XR Terminals: Enhanced Battery 
Performance
The XR terminal's energy-saving feature has 
a triple impact: enhancing battery life, 
alleviating terminal heating issues, and delivering a more comfortable user-wearing 
experience. For instance, consider a video frame 
rate of 60 fps, where the XR service transmits 
one frame of data packets at a 16.7 ms interval. 
In conventional solutions, the connected-mode 
discontinuous reception (C-DRX) period is 
typically an integer (e.g., 6/8/10/20/30), which 
doesn't precisely align with the XR service cycle. 
As data volume increases, this misalignment 
grows, resulting in noticeable jitter. 
The X-Edge solution introduces adaptive 
adjustments to wake-up signals by the gNodeB 
based on identi/f_ied period characteristics. This 
dynamic matching ensures that the C-DRX 
period aligns seamlessly with the XR service 
period. Simulations indicate a noteworthy 20% 
reduction in power consumption as a result of 
this intelligent adaptation, underlining the 
eﬃciency gains provided by the X-Edge 
solution.

support of 5G mmWave technology, VR 
large-space expedition applications have 
eﬀectively addressed operational eﬃciency 
challenges. The seamless integration of 
advanced technologies has not only optimized 
performance but has also ushered in a new era of 
immersive experiences on a grand scale. These 
applications, evolving continuously, are set to 
rede/f_ine the virtual reality landscape, oﬀering 
users an unparalleled cinematic journey within 
expansive virtual environments. 
Looking ahead, the market for VR 
large-space expedition applications is 
experiencing remarkable growth, surpassing a 
size of 10 billion yuan. This growth underscores 
the increasing popularity and commercial 
viability of these applications. With their ability 
to provide captivating and realistic 
experiences, VR large-space expedition 
applications are poised to lead the way in the 
widespread commercial utilization of VR 
services.
