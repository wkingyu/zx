ince the launch of 5G in 2018, 5G 
applications have been deployed at 
signi/f_icant scale. However, as the 
development of 5G applications 
continues, certain scenarios have emerged where the 
current capabilities of 5G such as extreme high speed 
exceed the actual demands, leading to higher costs 
for 5G terminals and posing challenges for 
large-scale deployment of 5G applications. 
The introduction of 5G reduced capability 
(RedCap), also referred to as NR Light, in 3GPP 
Release 17, came at the right time, achieving a 
trade-oﬀ of cost and performance. 5G RedCap 
obtains the advantages of low cost and low power 
consumption by reducing terminal complexity while 
inheriting unique characteristics from 5G such as 
high capacity, low latency and network slicing, 
enabling mid- and high-speed IoT scenarios and 
promoting the large-scale deployment of 5G 
applications. In the upcoming 3GPP Release 18, 
RedCap will further reduce the terminal capability. 
This version, called 5G eRedCap, can be described as 
the 5G/uni00A0equivalent of 4G Cat.1 and Cat. 1bis, extending 
the application boundary of 5G RedCap. 
Currently, three addressable 5G RedCap use cases 
are proposed in 3GPP Release 17. These include 
industrial wireless sensors, video surveillance, and 
wearables, which can be widely used across multiple 
vertical industries such as smart manufacturing, 
smart power grid, and smart city. The application of 
5G RedCap is poised to accelerate the digital 
transformation within these industries.
5G RedCap has broad prospects due to its 
cost-eﬀective advantage. The deployment of 5G 
RedCap will start to take shape in the coming years 
with China expected to lead the initial commercial 
deployment, followed by a phased global rollout. According to Counterpoint Research, 5G RedCap 
modules will constitute 18% of total cellular IoT module 
shipments by 2030, indicating the signi/f_icant market 
potential. In the long term, 5G RedCap provides an 
evolution path for existing mid-tier 4G connections.
ZTE “Basic + Enhanced + X” RedCap 
Solution
To address the application scenarios of 5G RedCap, 
ZTE has launched the “Basic + Enhanced + X” 5G 
RedCap Solution to facilitate the smooth rollout of 
RedCap across diﬀerent stages and various scenarios, 
enabling 5G RedCap to go from being "usable" to 
being “useful” . 
The basic 5G RedCap features ensure that RedCap 
terminals can smoothly access the existing 5G 
networks. When these terminals access the 5G 
network as a new type of 5G terminal, access control, 
user identi/f_ication and a /f_lexible bandwidth part 
(BWP) strategy are required. ZTE supports all these 
basic features to guarantee eﬃcient connectivity of 
5G RedCap terminals to the existing 5G network. 
The enhanced RedCap features aim to maximize the 
usage ratio of network resources. When integrated 
into the existing 5G network, the compatibility with 
both the existing network and terminals needs to be 
considered for 5G RedCap. ZTE supports the 5G 
RedCap enhancements in terms of capacity, 
coverage, and power saving. In terms of capacity, 
ZTE provides functions such as BWP Adaptive 
Adding and Deleting and Non-aligned Space 
Division Pairing to maximize spectrum eﬃciency 
and improve the user experience in large-capacity 
scenarios such as multi-channel concurrent 
high-de/f_inition video surveillance. In terms of 
coverage, recognizing that 5G RedCap with reduced
