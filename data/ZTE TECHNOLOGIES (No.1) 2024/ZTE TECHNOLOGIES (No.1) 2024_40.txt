Telecom introduced ZTE’s integrated 
sensing and communication (ISAC) 
technology, ensuring low-altitude security 
during the Asian Games. By utilizing this 
technology, a low-altitude security line is 
established at the entrance of the Asian 
Games Village. The 5G-A base station 
facilitates the detection of object positions 
and heights within a 1 km range, achieving 
sub-meter level accuracy.
Industry’s First 5G NTN Application in 
Sea Scenario Enables Real-Time 
Monitoring and Transmission of Water 
Quality Data
China Telecom and ZTE have successfully 
conducted the industry’s /f_irst 5G 
non-terrestrial network (NTN) application 
veri/f_ication in sea scenarios. In these sea 
and uninhabited island scenarios, seamless 
on-orbit interaction and eﬃcient business 
data transmission can be achieved, 
enabling real-time business veri/f_ication 
across multiple terminals and diverse 
situations. This encompasses sea water 
quality monitoring, uninhabited island 
temperature and humidity monitoring, 
as well as uninhabited island emergency 
distress management, yielding favorable 
outcomes.
Optimizing Network Operational 
Eﬃciency
Establishing a Comprehensive Control 
System Based on Digital Twin
In the face of the vast scale of networks, 
achieving rapid response and coordination 
is of great importance. Therefore, China 
Telecom collaborates with ZTE and other 
industry partners to contribute to the 
“Tianmu” control system. By leveraging the 
digital twin technology, they can realize 
a 3D venue rotation eﬀect for provincial 
sports events while establishing a robust 
“central brain” for safeguarding. This 
central brain empowers real-time control over large-scale communication networks, 
private networks, and critical services, 
facilitating eﬃcient command execution 
and accurate decision-making.
Cluster DFS Oﬀers Eﬀective Solutions 
for Uplink Capacity
China Telecom and ZTE has implemented 
the Cluster dynamic frame sharing 
(DFS) technology. By predicting traﬃc 
distribution characteristics, the frame 
structure is dynamically adjusted within 
base station clusters, enabling the network 
in Asian Games venues to eﬀectively 
cater to dynamic /f_luctuations in services. 
The data from Binjiang Gymnasium 
demonstrates that Cluster DFS enhances 
venue upstream capacity by over 60%, 
ensuring bandwidth for various upstream 
services including live streaming.
Intelligent Respiration Network Ensures 
Seamless Internet Access for A Multitude 
of Individuals
 To address network congestion issues in 
high-concurrency scenarios, China Telecom 
and ZTE have introduced the industry's /f_irst 
intelligent respiration network solution. 
This innovative approach leverages time 
and frequency-based traﬃc distribution 
trends to enable power shrinkage within 
the network through power sharing, 
thereby facilitating /f_lexible coverage 
adjustments. By eﬃciently allocating 
limited network resources, it eﬀectively 
caters to the requirements of multi-terminal 
high-concurrency services while ensuring 
an optimal user experience.
The collaboration between China Telecom 
and ZTE is driving progress and innovation, 
empowering the transformation of Hangzhou 
with cutting-edge technologies. Through 
the deployment of 5G-A innovations, they 
inject boundless vitality and enthusiasm into 
Hangzhou, ultimately establishing it as a 
smart city.
