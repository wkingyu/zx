diﬀerent use cases and environments.
Re/f_lective RIS is primarily used for on-demand signal 
re/f_lection in base stations. When obstacles between the 
base station and the user aﬀect signal quality and user 
experience, re/f_lective RIS can be deployed to re/f_lect 
the signal to the user’s location, thereby enhancing 
the signal there. This technology can be strategically 
placed in accessible areas like poles, billboards and 
walls, oﬀering cost-eﬀective deployment options. 
At the June 2023 Shanghai exhibition, ZTE unveiled 
its second-generation dynamic re/f_lective RIS, named 
D-RIS 2.0. This device boasts an 80% reduction in 
power consumption compared to its predecessor, 
thanks to advancements in new materials and 
architecture. It also supports IP65 for outdoor 
long-term deployment, oﬀering waterproof and 
dustproof capabilities.
Refractive RIS is primarily applied to glass surfaces, 
such as windows in buildings or carriage windows, 
to achieve outdoor coverage indoors or enhance 
coverage in high-speed train carriages. To avoid 
impacting indoor brightness, refractive RIS is typically 
designed in a transparent form and is therefore also 
referred to as transparent RIS.
Advanced Algorithm
In the early stages of RIS research, the typical 
approach was static RIS. However, the performance 
of static RIS is severely constrained due to the 
inability to dynamically adjust the antenna beam 
direction in response to changes in the environment 
and terminal positions. ZTE has developed D-RIS 
to address this challenge. D-RIS uses dynamic 
beamforming to automatically track devices in 
real-time as they move within the coverage area, 
connecting them to the strongest available link. 
This greatly expands the base station’s coverage 
and ensures an optimal user experience. To reduce 
the processing complexity of RIS and maintain 
its cost and power consumption at extremely 
low levels, ZTE’s D-RIS relies on the channel 
estimation capability of base stations. The base 
station guides the D-RIS through a beam sweeping 
process to determine the user’s location. As users 
engage in services, the base station signals the 
D-RIS through an in-band air interface to adopt 
the optimal beam direction towards the user. Additionally, this implementation preserves the 
interface protocols between base stations and 
terminals, allowing 5G commercial terminals to access the 
network through RIS without modi/f_ications. This enables 
operators to deploy RIS in their 5G networks well before its 
widespread introduction in 6G.
ZTE Leads Commercial RIS Trials in the Fields
 
ZTE leads multiple commercial RIS trials, demonstrating 
that D-RIS can address operators’ growing coverage and 
performance needs while reducing their CAPEX and OPEX.
In September 2023, the 19th Asian Games were held in 
Hangzhou, China. During the event, China Telecom and 
ZTE showcased cutting-edge 5G-Advanced technologies 
and implemented several smart projects. Notably, D-RIS 
emerged as a key technology, delivering cost-eﬀective 
and energy-eﬃcient features. It played a signi/f_icant role in 
ensuring ubiquitous 5G-Advanced coverage across sports 
venues and the Asian Games Village.
In the vicinity of the Hangzhou Asian Games venues, 
numerous high-rise buildings posed challenges to 
indoor 5G signal coverage due to non-line-of-sight 
(NLOS) conditions. To overcome this, RIS was rapidly 
deployed to expand the coverage of base station 
within living areas, shops and parking garages. This 
cost-eﬀective and eco-friendly solution ensures 
comprehensive indoor coverage, delivering consistently 
high data rates for users.
In sports venues, the demand for network capacity 
surged, particularly with the introduction of HD 8K sports 
broadcasts. 5G-Advanced technology facilitated seamless 
HD streaming of Asian Games events, providing continuous 
high-speed services for multiple devices. Despite ample 
bandwidth from high-frequency bands, coverage 
challenges existed. The combination of AAU with RIS at the 
Hangzhou Asian Games achieved full coverage within the 
competition venues, substantially reducing deployment 
costs and speeding up the deployment process.
It is imperative to embrace RIS to sustain 
high-capacity performance in as many indoor and 
outdoor venues as possible. Imagine enjoying streaming 
videos or making calls over a 1 Gbps connection from a 
millimeter-wave outdoor base station, then seamlessly 
moving indoors without any disruption—this is the true 
power of RIS.
