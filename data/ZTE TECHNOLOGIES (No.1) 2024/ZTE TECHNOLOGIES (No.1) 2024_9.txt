Network energy savings:  Network energy 
savings are key to 5G/NR success, aiming to 
reduce environmental impact (greenhouse 
gas emissions) and achieve operational cost 
savings. In the initial study conducted 
within RAN WGs, various techniques 
spanning time, frequency, spatial and 
power domains were investigated based on 
a network energy consumption model for 
base stations. Following that, the Rel-18 
work item introduced several new features 
including CSI enhancements for 
adaptations in spatial and power domains, 
Cell DTX/DRX mechanism in time domain, 
SSB-less SCell operation for inter-band CA, 
mechanism to prevent legacy UEs camping 
and enhancements on CHO procedure, as 
well as inter-node beam activation and 
enhancements on paging.
NTN/NTN-IoT: Rel-18 NR NTN work item 
speci/f_ies coverage enhancement, NR-NTN 
deployment in above 10 GHz bands, 
network-veri/f_ied UE location, and NTN-TN 
and NTN-NTN mobility and service 
continuity enhancements. Rel-18 RAN work 
item further enhances the IoT-NTN in three 
major areas: performance (HARQ and GNSS 
enhancements), measurement and mobility enhancements in both idle and connected 
modes, and enhancements in discontinuous 
coverage. It also complements the SA2 study 
on 5GC enhancements for satellite access 
Phase 2.
CN Part
For CN, 28 work items have been 
completed in R18, including 2 for intelligent 
network enablement, 11 for enhanced 
network services, 8 for vertical support, and 7 
for enhanced network convergence and 
coverage.
Network slicing phase 3 & eNSAC: These 
two work items are led by ZTE. In the 
network slicing phase 3, functional 
enhancements and deployment 
optimizations for 5GS network slicing are 
speci/f_ied. Key features include support for 
slice service continuity, service area not 
matching TA boundary, temporary or 
periodic slice deployment, multiple 
network slice admission control (NSAC) 
service area, partial slices in the registration 
area, and improved network control of UE 
usage. Based on the GSMA-de/f_ined 
network slice template, the eNSAC work 
item enhances the existing NSAC 
procedure to control the number of UEs 
with at least one PDU session/PDN 
connection per network slice in the case of 
EPC interworking. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With some study items and work 
items in Rel-18 and Rel-19, it is 
evident that some pre-research 
on 6G has been initiated in 
5G-Advanced.
