Introduction
n the surging tide of the information age, the 
development of integrated global 
communication networks encompassing sea, 
sky, and land has become a key driving 
force in societal progress. Despite signi/f_icant 
advancements in terrestrial network expansion, vast 
oceans and remote lands still face the reality of 
lacking network coverage, leaving a considerable 
proportion of the globe in an information isolation. 
Leveraging its profound technical expertise and 
insight into the era’s trends, ZTE has introduced the 
5G non-terrestrial network (NTN) solution based on 
3GPP standards. This article delves into ZTE 5G NTN 
concept, implementation, and prospects, 
illuminating how it sets a new direction for the future 
development of integrated satellite-terrestrial 
communication networks.
Satellite Communication: Meeting Urgent 
Demands for Comprehensive Coverage
Addressing the challenge of facilitating eﬀective 
communication and emergency responses in areas 
without terrestrial network coverage is a 
signi/f_icant hurdle facing the global 
communications industry. Satellite 
communication has emerged as a key solution to 
this challenge. The widespread deployment of 
satellite communication is gradually revealing its 
indispensable strategic role in the communications 
sector (Fig. 1). Leading companies are leveraging 
satellite communication as a breakthrough, 
exploring diverse technological pathways. 
SpaceX’s Starlink program has deployed over 5,000 
satellites in orbit, with a user base exceeding two million; the emerging force, AST SpaceMobile, is 
closely collaborating with numerous global 
operators to co-develop future strategies.
However, current satellite communication 
methods have their limitations. Traditional satellite 
telephony oﬀers stable signals and strong 
environmental adaptability but requires bulky, 
cumbersome terminals. Moreover, satellite 
broadband services, represented by Starlink, have 
made technical advancements, yet their terminal 
equipment and service fees remain relatively high, 
hindering widespread adoption.
ZTE 5G NTN: Achieving Universal 
Connectivity Through Space, Air, and Land 
Integration
ZTE has proposed a unique, 3GPP-compliant 5G 
NTN solution. This approach opens up 
communication channels for remote areas, providing 
not only convenience and eﬃciency in 
communication for users but also paving new 
avenues for economic growth within the industry.
In its initial phase, the solution leverages mature 
geostationary satellites. These high-orbit satellites 
eﬀectively cover vast areas, thereby signi/f_icantly 
reducing the number of satellites required. This 
approach not only conserves resources but also 
contributes to global environmental protection. The 
solution aligns with 3GPP standards, ensuring 
minimal resource utilization for emergency 
communication and IoT services. This marks a 
multifunctional and forward-looking milestone in 
telecommunications development.
As networks evolve to the next step, especially 
with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, the renewable 
network architecture will support satellite uplink
