Ultra-Reliable 5G Network for 
High-Level Autonomous Driving
ith the proliferation of 
intelligent vehicles on urban 
roads and the emergence of
automated applications such as unmanned 
delivery and street sweeping, autonomous 
driving is gradually transitioning from a mere 
concept to a remarkable reality. As a crucial 
pillar of economic development, the 
transportation industry is actively seeking 
transformation by seamlessly integrating 
vehicle, road, network, and cloud intelligence 
to empower smarter cities. Autonomous 
driving is no longer merely the job of 
individual vehicles. 
High-level autonomous driving refers to a 
mode where machines autonomously 
undertake most driving tasks, truly liberating 
drivers’ hands, eyes, and feet while bringing 
unparalleled convenience into our lives. 
However, this also imposes higher demands 
on automation precision. 
The advancement of vehicle intelligence 
is currently impeded by the lack of synergy 
with arti/f_icial intelligence in other domains. 
High-level autonomous driving vehicles 
require an extensive array of on-board 
cameras, radars, and computing chips, which 
can be quite costly. In terms of safety, the 
limited /f_ield of view and perception distance 
of on-board sensors may result in blind spots 
and delayed awareness. In addition, 
single-vehicle decision-making lacks eﬃcient 
coordination between vehicles and road 
systems, leading to inaccurate predictions in 
complex scenarios. In consequence, 
single-vehicle intelligence has remained 
stagnant at L2 for an extended period with wsigni/f_icant challenges for advancement.
With the advancement of 5G technology, 
the industry envisions harnessing the 
potential of this cutting-edge technology to 
enhance both quality and eﬃciency in 
autonomous driving solutions, propelling 
continuous improvements in autonomous 
driving through 5G+ vehicle-road-cloud 
integration. 
ZTE has introduced the industry’s /f_irst 
ultra-reliable 5G network guarantee solution 
for autonomous driving (Fig. 1), dedicated to 
providing low-latency and trustworthy 
service connections for autonomous 
vehicles. The solution incorporates two 
major highlights: ultra-reliable 5G 
transmission and ultra-reliable computing 
service.
Ultra-Reliable 5G Transmission
5G naturally boasts numerous advantages 
over the conventional PC5 vehicle-road 
transmission system. The latter is limited to a 
mere 20 MHz bandwidth, posing challenges 
in terms of future evolution and 
commercialization capability. In addition to 
5G’s inherent large bandwidth and low 
latency, ZTE has also employed various 
network guarantee techniques to further 
ensure transmission reliability. 
Firstly, the 5G dual-modem gateway 
enables dual-link transmission and 
selective reception, eﬀectively mitigating 
potential delays caused by single-link 
package loss that could compromise both 
driving safety and eﬃciency in
