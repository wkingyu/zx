he extended reality (XR) industry 
stands as one of the seven key 
industries for the development of the 
digital economy, given its potential 
to lead us into the future meta-universe. With the 
widespread commercial use of 5G, XR businesses 
have reached a crucial point. According to 
Statista’s forecast, XR market revenue is projected 
to reach USD 250 billion by 2028, with the B2C 
segment expected to reach USD 52 billion by 
2027. Additionally, by 2026, the combined 
shipment of head-mounted display devices in 
both augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality 
(VR) categories is forecasted to more than triple, 
exceeding 35 million sets.
So far, "Horizon of Khufu" has emerged as a 
popular VR expedition, guiding viewers through 
a captivating journey spanning 4,500 years of 
global history and showcasing the true 
commercial potential of the VR industry. 
Launched in Shanghai for three months, this 
project has already generated over 10 million 
RMB in revenue, signaling the signi/f_icant impact 
that VR expedition applications can have on 
large-scale commercial use. 
However, there are noteworthy challenges 
associated with the current backpack solution. It 
weighs over 5 kg and the fan outlet gets heated, 
causing discomfort during prolonged use. This 
discomfort poses a barrier to the participation of 
the elderly and children. Additionally, the Wi-Fi 
has weak wireless capability, limited coverage, and fails to meet the demands of large spaces. As 
a result, the concurrent user capacity is hindered, 
leading to ineﬃciencies in commercial 
operations.  
Addressing VR Expedition Challenges 
with 5G mmWave X-Edge Solution
Instead of using a backpack, the solution 
involves cloud rendering and accessing a 
millimeter-wave mobile network. This not only 
eliminates the interference caused by multiple 
Wi-Fi connections but also improves mobility, 
allowing the elderly and children to be 
free from the weight of a backpack. ZTE's 
ultra-large-bandwidth millimeter wave device 
can support the industry’s largest 1.6 GHz 
bandwidth and a single-cell peak data rate of 
28 Gbps, eﬀectively meeting the requirements 
for large-capacity concurrent users in a VR 
theater mode with a spacious environment. This 
wireless network solution oﬀers a zero-to-one 
approach, establishing a robust business model 
for this service.
In particular, the intelligent identi/f_ication 
function on the base station side accurately 
identi/f_ies XR services, ensuring a diﬀerentiated 
service experience. Intelligent scheduling reduces 
delay and jitter in XR services, while capacity 
enhancement guarantees a smooth user 
experience in large-capacity scenarios.
