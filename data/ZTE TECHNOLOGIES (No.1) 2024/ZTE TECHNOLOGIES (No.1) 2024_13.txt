such as autostereoscopy, cloud computer, 
XR metaverse, ultra-high-de/f_inition live 
streaming, and 5G machine vision are 
driving the 5G experience from Gbps+ 
to 10 Gbps+ ZTE is the /f_irst in the industry 
to achieve a mid-frequency evolution from 
64 TR to 128 TR, doubling the 5G network 
capacity. With FR2 products based on 
the industry‚Äôs largest 1.6 GHz bandwidth, 
ZTE achieves a super capacity of 28 Gbps. 
Coupled with the industry‚Äôs /f_irst dynamic 
recon/f_igurable intelligent surface (RIS) base 
station collaboration, it enhances base station 
coverage by more than 30%, supporting a 
ubiquitous, wide-bandwidth experience.
The seamless 10 Gbps+ network 
infrastructure has given birth to diverse 
5G-Advanced application scenarios. In 
Shanghai, the ‚Äú5G vehicle-ground system‚Äù 
featuring small cells on vehicle and 10 Gbps+ 
wireless backhaul has achieved the world‚Äôs 
/f_irst launch with a backhaul capacity of up 
to 15 Gbps on the downlink and 2 Gbps 
on the uplink, providing passengers with stable 5G connection and high-speed 
experience anytime,  anywhere. The 
industry‚Äôs /f_irst 5G-Advanced ship-ground 
backhaul system creates a 10 Gbps+ cruise 
ship, reaching a peak downlink speed of 
over 11 Gbps for a single terminal, and 
can simultaneously support hundreds 
of anchors for ultra-high-de/f_inition 
live streaming in Hangzhou. In the 
China Media Group‚Äôs production and 
broadcasting technology exhibition 
area at the Hangzhou International Expo 
Center, the 5G-Advanced integrated 
computing network CampSite solution, 
with its simpli/f_ied architecture and 
/f_lexible deployment, achieved a 
measured uplink speed of over 2 Gbps, 
over 10 Gbps downlink speed, and a 
network transmission delay of less than 
4 ms. This supports fast deployment of 
ultra-high-de/f_inition shallow compression, 
and virtual and real-time video production 
and broadcasting. The 5G-Advanced 
10 Gbps+ network can also support dozens
