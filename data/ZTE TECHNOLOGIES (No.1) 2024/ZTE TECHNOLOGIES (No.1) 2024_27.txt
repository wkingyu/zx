emergency scenarios.
Secure  and reliable, exceptional trust: In the 
realm of global telecommunications, security 
and reliability are paramount. ZTE 5G NTN 
solution is built on advanced encryption and 
robust communication protocols, ensuring 
secure communication across all channels. The 
system’s resilience and reliability are engineered 
to ensure consistent performance, even under 
challenging environmental conditions. This 
reliability is crucial for addressing critical 
communication needs, especially in scenarios 
involving natural disasters, remote explorations, 
and maritime emergencies.
Rapid Technological Advancements in ZTE 
5G NTN
After the R17 NTN standard was frozen in June 
2022, ZTE has initiated a series of technical 
experiments and commercial applications 
worldwide. In May 2023, ZTE, in partnership with 
China Telecom and VIVO, completed the /f_irst 5G NTN 
direct-to-cell /f_ield trial in China. This trial utilized 
domestically developed communication satellites 
and ground mobile communication systems, with 
ZTE’s 5G base stations featuring NTN capabilities. It 
overcame crucial technical challenges such as 
frequency and time synchronization in geostationary 
orbit satellite communications, verifying the 
capabilities for base stations. This enables existing 
network terminals to connect directly to satellites 
without the need for modi/f_ications. The signi/f_icant 
economies of scale brought about by existing 
terminals and their satellite links will rapidly 
reduce the cost of satellite connections, 
showcasing the potential for large-scale 
commercial applications.
Universal bene/f_its, diverse integration:  
Compared to other satellite communication 
methods, the 5G NTN solution, grounded in the 
3GPP standard, oﬀers distinct advantages in terms 
of terminal ubiquity, industry integration, and 
service versatility. This places it at the forefront of 
satellite-terrestrial integration technology. 
Currently, 5G NTN excels in IoT-NTN short 
messaging and IoT services, and in the future, it 
will support NR-NTN voice and broadband data 
services for existing mobile phones.
Customer priority, enhanced experience:  At 
the core of  ZTE 5G NTN solution is a dedication 
to enhancing user experience. The technology 
transforms ordinary smartphones into advanced 
communication devices capable of connecting 
via satellite, enabling individuals in the most 
remote areas to access reliable network services. 
For industry users, the solution ensures 
robust, reliable, and cost-eﬀective 
communication—essential for eﬃcient 
operations in maritime, logistics, and
