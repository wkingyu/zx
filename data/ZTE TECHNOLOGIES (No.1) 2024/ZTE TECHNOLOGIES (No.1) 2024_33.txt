transmitted through one node but 
processed and computed at the other 
location, such as a central cloud or regional 
computing center. This results in 
prolonged transmission delays and 
increased investment. ZTE has innovatively 
merged 5G network and computing 
capability by simply inserting a computing 
board, NodeEngine, into 5G base stations. 
This allows service data to be processed 
locally in real time, rather than being 
transmitted over long distances, thereby 
accelerating decision-making processes. 
NodeEngine boasts plug-and-play 
functionality, delivering exceptional 
performance and ample capacity to enable 
real-time processing and sending of 
roadside perception data. This deployment 
method eliminates the need for new 
machine rooms, leveraging existing base 
station resources to reduce the 
deployment costs and the deployment 
time. Moreover, computing power can be 
shared across base stations to form an edge 
cloud, ensuring uninterrupted service 
delivery. It is estimated that a single base 
 
autonomous vehicles. Additionally, to 
ensure the independent transmission of 
both links, two distinct frequency points 
are adopted, thereby minimizing 
interference and maximizing the 
bandwidth resources of V2X services. For 
instance, a 100M private V2X network can 
be virtually created on the existing 100M 
public network, restricting public network 
users from accessing the private V2X 
network, thus enhancing transmission 
reliability. Moreover, through intelligent 
pre-scheduling, required service resources 
and periodicity can be accurately 
identi/f_ied, allowing the network side to 
proactively provide dynamic resource 
reservations for terminals, thereby 
reducing service latency. Overall, ZTEâ€™s 
solution achieves a low latency of 20 ms 
and a high reliability of 99.99%, 
demonstrating industry leading 
performance for driving safety.
