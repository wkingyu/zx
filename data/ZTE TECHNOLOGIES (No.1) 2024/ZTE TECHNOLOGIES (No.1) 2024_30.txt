AAU.  
 
 
 
Standard evolution: In 3GPP Release 18, 
supporting up to 24 DMRS ports for both 
uplink and downlink is achievable 
without additional DMRS overhead. 
Release 19, speci/f_ic to 128TR, introduces 
support for 128 port CSI-RS. This 
enhancement improves channel state 
information estimation and utilization, 
facilitating better beamforming and 
overall network optimization.
We have successfully tested the /f_irst 
128TR massive MIMO AAU at 4.9 GHz in 
collaboration with China Mobile. The results 
demonstrate that on a 100 MHz single 
carrier, the downlink peak data rate of the 
cell is 10.3 Gbps, twice the current 5G 
network’s maximum spectrum eﬃciency. 
The uplink peak data rate is 2.8 Gbps, 2.4 
times the existing 5G network’s maximum 
spectrum eﬃciency.
During the festival of lights event in China 
(Nov. 21–30), the 128TR AAU outperformed 
64TR sites, boosting downlink and uplink rates by 70% and improving spectrum 
eﬃciency by over 40%. It excelled in 
emergency support at large-scale concerts 
with 800+ connected users, and its 
power-saving scheme reduced 
consumption to watt-levels, ensuring 
considerable energy savings for base 
stations. 
ZTE’s UBR Series for Site Simplicity 
and Energy Eﬃciency
In response to the needs of both 
developed and developing markets, ZTE 
oﬀers a comprehensive ultra-broadband 
radio (UBR) series based on the 
new-generation platform, providing 
simpli/f_ied and energy-eﬃcient solutions to 
CSPs. These solutions aim to optimize TCO 
through simpli/f_ied site deployment and 
signi/f_icant energy savings.
Simpli/f_ied site deployment: ZTE’s UBR 
series streamlines tower sites with unique 
features. It includes the industry’s only
