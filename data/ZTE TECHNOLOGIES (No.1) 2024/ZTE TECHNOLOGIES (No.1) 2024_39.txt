RIS can seamlessly move along with users. 
In addition to the Asian Games Village, the 
Binjiang Gymnasium has also implemented 
dynamic RIS deployment, facilitating 8K UHD 
live broadcasting services. Moreover, along the 
10 km footpath by the Qiantang River, real-time 
testing and display of sports data become 
achievable through beam tracking based on 
dynamic RIS technology, thereby contributing 
to the advancement of sports development.

Across Diverse Scenarios
Industry’s First 5G Smallcell in Ship and 5G-A 
Backhaul System for Qiantang River Cruises
As one of the prominent water tourism 
routes in Hangzhou, the Qiantang River serves 
as a signi/f_icant destination for online anchors. 
However, signal re/f_lection on the river and 
substantial attenuation caused by ships make 
traditional networks inadequate to meet the 
demands of multiple anchors. In collaboration 
with ZTE, China Telecom has successfully 
deployed cutting-edge 1.6 GHz ultra-large 
5G-A equipment on the Qiantang River. This 
deployment enables a single terminal downlink 
peak exceeding 11 Gbps, facilitating numerous 
anchors in conducting high-de/f_inition live 
broadcasts. Additionally, an innovative 5G 
smallcell and 5G-A backhaul system have been 
implemented on cruise ships, signi/f_icantly enhancing user experience by more than 
tenfold.
5G-A Nomadic Base Station Facilitates 
New Business of China Media Group
China Telecom and China Media Group 
(CMG) have collaborated to implement a 
new lightweight business for new media 
based on 5G-A. Leveraging ZTE’s 5G-A private 
network and nomadic base stations, they can 
achieve stable transmission of uplink 2G+ 
ultra-large capacity and 4k live broadcasts 
with a shallow compression ratio of 1:8. 
By incorporating real-time chroma keying 
in live broadcasting, low-latency virtual 
interaction within the same frame can be 
experienced. This technology has been 
successfully applied to numerous CMG 
new media programs.
RedCap and ISAC Enable Low-Cost 
Ground and Air Inspections
China Telecom and ZTE have 
implemented the reduced capability 
(RedCap) technology in Hangzhou Smart 
E Valley. Leveraging the advantages of 
RedCap’s high capacity and low latency, 
real-time ground image acquisition and 
transmission can be achieved, enabling 
cost-eﬀective campus inspections. 
Intelligent solutions are also being 
applied in the low-altitude domain. China
