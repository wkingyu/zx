Reducing Limitations on Mobile 
Network Infrastructure 
In China, most metro systems were built 
with a distance of about 1 meter from tunnels 
to train carriages. However, a minimum of 1.2 
meters is needed for installing new cables, 
considering isolation and security 
requirements. Insuﬃcient power is another 
factor. To support 5G service and new signal 
sources (5G RRUs), the power supply needs to 
increase from 60 kW to at least 100 kW. The 
cable-based solution faces obstacles, with 
network signals signi/f_icantly weakened inside 
the metro due to signal attenuation from 
dense metal carriages and the Doppler Eﬀect 
caused by the train’s rapid movement.
The 5G-Advanced powered smart metro 
solution innovatively relocates network 
equipment deployment from tunnels to 
metro carriages, eﬀectively addressing China 
Telecom’s space limitations and signal 
attenuation challenges caused by dense 
metal carriages. 
Creating More Value for 
Mobile Operators
5G-Advanced powered smart metro is 
the most cutting-edge solution for specialized 5G network coverage. With a 
quadrupled average downlink speed, 
equivalent to upgrading from 480p to 
1080p video quality, it achieves a 15 Gbps 
high-speed backhaul through the 
millimeter-wave technology. This 
technology supports approximately 75 
channels of 8K HD camera live-streams 
simultaneously. Metro mobile users, on 
average, consume three times more 
payload. This unique solution allows for 
deployment across over 190 metro models, 
providing mobile operators with increased 
collaboration opportunities with various 
industrial partners. The achievement is 
attributed to its unique architecture and 
innovative products (Fig. 1).

Speci/f_ically, slim BBU and Qcell (pRRU) are 
used for in-metro coverage, while 
5G-Advanced AAUs deployed in tunnels 
serve as high-speed backhaul, receiving 
data from CPEs at both ends of the train 
simultaneously. Construction time has 
been reduced from one year to six 
months.
