most signi/f_icant challenges to solve. Despite 
being put forward early on, there are no good 
real-world solutions in physical production. In 
addition, their association with AI models is weak, 
and advancements in AI models have little impact 
on these technologies.
Technical potential analysis: Self-adaptive 
organization, exploration, intelligent prompt 
words, memory, and dialogue have potential for 
further development, which may be crucial for 
creating the gap between agent levels in the 
short term.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mainstream agent products are categorized 
according to their technical level, as shown in 
Table 1.
We conduct further paper scanning and research 
on the technologies mentioned in Table 1, and /f_ind 
the following:
Technology maturity analysis: Despite many 
papers on the technologies marked with 
underlines in the table, there is a lack of mature 
solution in industrial environments.
