and network observation assistant.
The assurance assistant, utilized in major 
activity support scenarios, has a high degree of 
automation. It replicates real work/f_lows to a virtual 
space, where key support experts, assistants, and 
troubleshooting experts work together to 
automatically complete work/f_lows. They 
communicate with people through 
summarization, reporting and risk assessment. 
This is a complex type of job agent, developed 
with the aim of achieving L5 fully autonomous 
network.
The other three agents are technically task agents:
Intelligent Q&A: This agent is to build a ToB-oriented 
knowledge base application based on the 
RAG+agent technology.
Fault assistant: Facilitated by the fault knowledge 
bases and APIs, this agent assists O&M personnel 
in quickly troubleshooting faults.
Network observation assistant:  Utilizing both 
large and small models, multiple agents perform 
network analysis across various dimensions. They 
then send their /f_indings to the general network 
insight agent, which summarizes them and outputs network observation results. 
Agent Development Trends and 
Technology Breakdown   
At present, the mainstream types of agents in the 
academic community are consistent with the 
experimental results of ZTE. They are as follows:
Logic agent: This kind of agent generates 
languages and multi-modal outputs based on its 
understanding of input languages and 
multi-modal data.
Task agent: Designed for speci/f_ic tasks, this agent 
breaks down plans and performs corresponding 
operations. It lacks long-term memory during the 
process.
Job agent: Oriented to abstract work responsibilities 
and overarching objectives, this agent perceives the 
environment, remembers process status, and 
generates sub-objectives to advance the work.  
From the perspective of development trends, 
self-evolving agents are also important, as they can 
self-learn.
