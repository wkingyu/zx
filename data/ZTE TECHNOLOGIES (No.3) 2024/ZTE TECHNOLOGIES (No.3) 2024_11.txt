Current Technologies and Principles 
of Agents
rom its initial structure-based de/f_inition to 
its current multi-modal model, the concept 
of an agent has gone through the phases of 
tools, social agents, work/f_lows, multi-agent 
cooperation, and multiple modalities. Currently, an 
agent is de/f_ined as a virtual role based on the AI 
model with the ability to learn, remember, perceive the environment, recall past experiences, plan 
target tasks and execute them to in/f_luence the 
environment. 
Each part of the agent, as shown in Fig. 1, is described 
as follows: 
Thinking and skills:  The agent receives task 
objectives from users, plans tasks using the 
LLM, and maps sub-tasks to the corresponding 
skills. Skills include indirect instruction 
communication for other agents’ production

Less than three months after the release of ChatGPT 3.5 in early 2023, the paper on large  language  model 
(LLM)-powered autonomous agents was published, igniting immediate interest in AI agent technology. GPTs 
or customized versions of ChatGPT were launched at the OpenAI Developer Conference in November 2023. At 
present, agents have become a mainstream product of AI models.
Compared to general-purpose AI model products, agents, whether role-playing or task-speciﬁc, are technically 
easier to control. They oﬀer more accurate outputs and are easier for users to understand and adjust. We will 
conduct an agent review to guide our follow-up research and work direction. JUN 2024
