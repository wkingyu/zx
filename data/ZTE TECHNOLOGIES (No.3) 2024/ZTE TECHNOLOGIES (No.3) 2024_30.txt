ith the acceleration of digital 
transformation in the industry, 
intelligent operation and 
maintenance (O&M) requirements 
within the telecom /f_ield are becoming increasingly 
complex. Consequently, intelligent O&M has 
emerged as one of the key factors for maintaining 
competitiveness in the digital era. However, due to 
the rapid development of services and continuous 
technological updates, traditional O&M methods are 
inadequate to meet the evolving O&M requirements 
of communication devices. The advent of AI model 
has brought breakthroughs in the /f_ield of intelligent 
O&M. It oﬀers a more user-friendly man-machine 
interaction mode, processes massive structured data, 
delivers high-precision analysis and prediction, and 
empowers advanced O&M capabilities.
Applications of AI Model in Intelligent O&M
The AI model technology has been widely used in 
intelligent O&M in the telecom /f_ield, which includes 
O&M knowledge Q&A, fault and exception detection, 
root cause location, and fault prediction and 
prevention.
O&M knowledge Q&A: When the AI model is 
utilized in the telecom /f_ield for knowledge 
questions and answers, its capabilities in storage, 
memory, understanding, and application become 
especially crucial. By analyzing a large amount of 
communication data and technical documents, 
the AI model can deeply understand various WAI Model Empowers Intelligent 
Operation and Maintenance for 
Eﬃciency Enhancement
communication devices, protocols, and network 
topologies. This comprehensive understanding 
allows the AI model to eﬃciently integrate 
contextual information when addressing complex 
communication issues, and quickly and accurately 
generate answers to questions. Additionally, the AI 
model also has the capability to continuously 
update and re/f_ine its knowledge base based on 
real-time communication data and the latest 
industry trends to keep pace with the latest 
knowledge and provide timely and reliable 
support and guidance for operation and 
maintenance personnel.
Fault and exception detection: Utilizing AI-model 
intelligent algorithms and models, the system 
processes and analyzes collected data to identify 
abnormal data or behaviors that are inconsistent 
with the normal status. This typically involves 
feature extraction, data modeling and classi/f_ication, 
and formulation of abnormal judgment standards. 
In practice, to enhance detection accuracy and 
robustness, considerations for data temporal 
characteristics, spatial correlations, and trends over 
time are often necessary. Moreover, tailored 
algorithms and models may be required to 
accommodate diverse data characteristics and 
business needs in various domains and application 
scenarios. Furthermore, continuous updates and 
optimizations of algorithms and models are 
essential to ensure system reliability and stability, 
enabling adaptation to new fault types and 
changes in scenarios.
