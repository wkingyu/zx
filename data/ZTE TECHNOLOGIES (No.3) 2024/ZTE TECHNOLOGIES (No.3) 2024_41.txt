hosts approximately 14.27 million /f_ixed broadband 
(FBB) users, boasting a household penetration of  
around 58.96%.  Notably, 95% of these users rely on

Wyndham Royal Lee Phuket stands as a high-end serviced-apartment-style community meticulously 
crafted by Wyndham Hotels and Resorts in 
Thailand. After years of operation, the network 
infrastructure of accommodation had become 
outdated, failing to cater to the evolving Wi-Fi 
usage needs of its guests. Recognizing the 
imperative for an upgraded solution, True and ZTE 
joined forces during the refurbishment of the 
Wyndham Royal Lee Phuket. This collaboration 
resulted in the development of an industry-leading, 
all-optical Wi-Fi solution tailored to meet the 
speci/f_ic needs of Wyndham Royal Lee Phuket.
