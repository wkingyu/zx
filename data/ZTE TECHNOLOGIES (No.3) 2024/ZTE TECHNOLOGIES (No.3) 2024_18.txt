train, evaluate, implement, and update AI models, 
ZTE provides a component-based AI platform—AI 
studio (AIS). Integrated into the intelligent AIO 
computing system or AI application, the AIS covers 
work/f_lows such as data collection, data annotation, 
model training, model /f_ine-tuning, knowledge 
base management, compilation optimization, and 
inference deployment. Supporting PyTorch and 
other mainstream AI frameworks, it delivers 
end-to-end intelligent computing center solutions, 
model capabilities and operational engines for AI 
applications.
AI Models and Applications: From 
Universal to Dedicated  
ZTE has articulated its strategy for empowering 
enterprises’ digital transformation with 
large-scale models as "1+N+X", transitioning from 
"universal" to "dedicated".
“1” Base AI Model Series
Using its engineering capabilities, ZTE 
independently develops the Nebula base AI 
models series, including NLP and multi-mode 
models. Leveraging vast training data and using 
unsupervised or self-supervised learning methods, 
ZTE demonstrates exceptional understanding and 
expression capabilities in diﬀerent tasks and 
domains.from leading GPU manufacturers worldwide. 
Additionally, through extensive collaboration with 
domestic head-end GPU manufacturers, ZTE has 
undertaken signi/f_icant self-development eﬀorts, 
providing diverse end-to-end intelligent computing 
solutions. These include high-performance AI servers 
utilizing chips from the leading GPU manufacturers, 
box-type and frame-type RoCE switches, and 
distributed storage servers supporting 
high-performance, multi-dimensional storage (such as 
/f_iles, objects, blocks, and big data). 
In addition, AI model training with tens of billions 
of parameters is time-consuming due to large 
training data. To ensure stability and reliability, and 
avoid interruptions caused by hardware faults, ZTE’s 
TECS resource management platform oﬀers a 
secure visual management tool for automatic 
monitoring. It also provides breakpoint training 
renewal service, minimizing interruption time and 
greatly reducing losses.
AI Platform: Openness and Decoupling
ZTE AI platform, centered on openness and 
decoupling, oﬀers complete AI products. It provides 
a uni/f_ied programming environment and tool 
chain, minimizing model development and 
migration costs while facilitating ecosystem 
construction.
To help developers and users better develop,
