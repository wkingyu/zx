where data is generated and consumed, the system 
can harness the potential of intelligent service 
analysis. The integration of AI models into the 5G 
network empowers industries to tailor their services 
according to speci/f_ic requirements, ensuring optimal 
performance and responsiveness. Through 
continuous monitoring and analysis, the system can 
dynamically adapt to changing conditions, providing 
diﬀerentiated service guarantees tailored to the 
unique needs of each industrial sector. 
5G Empowers AI Model
As an information infrastructure in the digital era, 
the 5G network boasts high bandwidth, low latency, 
and massive access, greatly enhancing the 
industry’s data collection capabilities and enriching 
AI model datasets. At the same time, as 5G networks 
are widely used in industries, AI models will play a 
pivotal role in the digital and intelligent 
transformation of these industries. 
5G Network Enhances AI Data Sets
In the industry intelligence process, data stands as 
the core element shaping the competitiveness of AI 
models. The 5G network supports multiple access 
modes like IP/LAN, overcoming mobility restrictions 
 
substantial bandwidth, while production control 
services prioritize low latency. Therefore, 5G 
networks need to provide SLA guarantees tailored to 
diﬀerent users or services. On the core network side, 
AI models can be used to evaluate and predict user 
service quality and generate service guarantee 
policies in time. On the wireless side, these AI models 
analyze wireless signals and sensor data to 
implement more accurate resource allocation and 
scheduling, thereby enhancing network eﬃciency 
and quality. 
AI Model Enables Intelligent Service Analysis 
In industrial application scenarios, stringent 
security protocols often dictate that data must 
remain con/f_ined within speci/f_ic areas to mitigate 
potential risks. However, the emergence of advanced 
AI models and algorithms has heralded a 
transformative solution to this challenge. With the 
introduction of AI models and algorithms, the 5G 
network can analyze and intelligently classify data 
traﬃc in real time without compromising security 
protocols. This innovative approach enables 
industries not only to uphold con/f_identiality 
protocols but also to extract valuable insights from 
the data generated within their con/f_ines. By
