Safeguard” anti-fraud 
big model system.
 
 
 
daily average number of overseas junk SMS 
messages dropped from 500,000 to 600,000 to 
20,000 to 30,000. The forecast success rate and 
interception accuracy rate can reach up to 99%. 
In addition, the number of fraud-related cases 
has signi/f_icantly decreased. In August 2023, the 
month-on-month ratio of overseas 
fraud-related cases decreased by 64%. 
Following the oﬃce’s provisioning, the system 
received high acclaim from the operator and the 
anti-fraud center of the province.
Operator B’s achievements:  The total number of 
mobile-originated (MO) messages initiated by 
domestic terminals is 4 million per day, all of which 
are monitored by the Smart Safeguard system. 
The average daily interception success rate for 
junk and fraudulent messages has increased from 
57.25% to 93.60%. The false interception ratio has 
reduced from 42.75% to 6.4%.
In addition, ZTE’s AI anti-fraud technologies have 
been chosen by China’s Ministry of Industry and 
Information Technology as an innovative technology 
application for preventing and controlling telecom 
fraud, and they have been promoted nationwide.  
Future Evolution and Prospect 
The introduction of anti-fraud model marks the beginning of AI model application in the 
communication sector. The Smart Safeguard series 
models will be developed, evolved, and applied 
across multiple domains, including service scope, 
media capabilities, and industrial applications.
Field expansion and capability openness:  ZTE 
will achieve capability replication and openness, 
further exploring the application of anti-fraud 
governance in 5G communication, IT, and 
content release.
Computer vision model:  Besides SMS text 
content anti-fraud, multimedia content is a 
fast-growing form of telecom fraud. To ensure 
that media content is trustworthy, secure, and 
reliable in the new 5G communications era, the 
Smart Safeguard model must eﬃciently identify 
and combat  fraudulent multimedia content in 
the future. 
Industrial model: 5G industrial customers have 
diverse requirements including intelligent 
dialogues, industrial knowledge services, and 
enterprise applications. By supporting L0/L1/L2 
AI models and integrating them into platforms 
on the new communications network side, such 
as the 5G messaging platform, ZTE “Smart 
Safeguard” model can rapidly meet the AI 
capability requirements of 5G industrial 
communication, eﬀectively serving government 
and enterprise customers.
