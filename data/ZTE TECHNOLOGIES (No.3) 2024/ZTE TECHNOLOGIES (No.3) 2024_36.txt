The rapid advancement of artiﬁcial intelligence(AI) is revolutionizing various industries, ushering in a new era of 
innovation. Pioneering AI models such as ChatGPT and Sora by OpenAI, and Gemini by Google are at the forefront of this 
transformation, providing users with an expanded realm for creativity and imagination and opening up unprecedented 
possibilities. AI models are fundamentally reshaping social structures and daily routines by improving the ability to 
generate new ideas, solve complex problems, and automate routine tasks. Tang Xue, Vice President of ZTE, recently 
shared valuable insights and experiences with experts from diverse ﬁelds at the GSMA panel on Convergence of 5G & AI 
at the Edge during MWC2024 in Barcelona, Spain.Tang Xue, Vice Preside nt of ZTE
“The integration of 5G and AI oﬀers both opportunities 
and challenges for 5G network development and 
monetization. It unlocks innovative applications like 
deterministic connections, edge rendering, and V2X 
applications.”
Tang Xue emphasized/uni00A0 that the integration of 
5G and AI is inevitable, ushering more 
possibilities for new business models and 
applications. As the/uni00A0 edge node/uni00A0 closest to users, 
performing AI processing at 5G network can 
eﬀectively reduce data transmission delay, 
improve data processing eﬃciency, and reduce 
the cost of AI applications. While 5G networks 
provide large bandwidth, high speed, and low latency, making it ideal for supporting the 
connection and computing requirements for 
distributed AI computing. The integration of 5G 
and AI not only can achieve /f_lexible collaboration 
of cloud and network, but also provide stronger 
intelligent capabilities, allowing 5G to adaptively 
optimize and adjust according to data 
characteristics and scenario requirements, 
improving network performance and eﬃciency.
